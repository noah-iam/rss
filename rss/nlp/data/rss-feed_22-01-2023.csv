The most important reason was that we also wanted to settle there as US citizens and secondly, in case we were not able to get the citizenship, at least our child would be a US citizen,” said the advocate from Satlasna, who had returned from the US in 2019 without getting citizenship for himself and wife.The advocate, who belongs to 42 Gaam Patidar Samaj, secured a citizenship for his child, who studies in a government-run primary school in Kadi.“In our community, it has become mandatory that a boy should be working in the US to get a bride. My child is a US citizen only and he may travel there anytime. I succeeded in securing his future,” he said.Read AlsoTrump wall death: Brijkumar Yadav’s wife in US, but incommunicadoThe Trump wall death case, in which Kalol resident Brijkumar Yadav fell to his death while scaling a wall on the Mexico-US border, is stuck with another deadlock — Pooja Yadav, the deceased’s wife, who was under the supervision of a US agency, has gone incommunicado.In September 2022, a couple from Kalol taluka of Gandhinagar district were deported to the Indira Gandhi International (IGI) airport in New Delhi from Dubai as they made an attempt to travel to the US illegally.“The man and his wife wanted to travel to the US to deliver their child. The woman was around four months pregnant and they had even identified a nursing home and an accommodation for the delivery,” said an officer of Delhi police, adding that they have come across many cases where people plan their deliveries in the US. A Gujarat police officer confirmed this trend saying that some of the couples even take help of IVF (in vitro fertilization) to conceive at a particular time and plan their journey to the US accordingly.“There is another angle to this planning: If a woman is pregnant and if she is caught, then the US authorities will show leniency and are likely to provide her a shelter,” said an officer of Gujarat police.

		            JPMorgan investment arm purges its ESG funds of Adani stocksSECTIONSJPMorgan investment arm purges its ESG funds of Adani stocksBy Natasha White, BloombergLast Updated: Feb 27, 2023, 05:02 PM ISTRate StoryShareFont SizeAbcSmallAbcMediumAbcLargeSavePrintCommentSynopsisThe JPMorgan Global Emerging Markets Research Enhanced Index Equity ESG UCITS ETF  offloaded the more than 70,000 shares in cement manufacturer ACC Ltd., exiting a stake it’s held since May 2021, according to a data review by Bloomberg that looked at movements following the Jan. 24 publication of the Hindenburg report.ETMarkets.comThe asset management unit of JPMorgan Chase & Co. has wiped its ESG portfolios clean of their exposure to the Adani empire.The move, captured by an analysis of data compiled by Bloomberg, comes as a number of major investment firms such as BlackRock Inc. and the fund management unit of Deutsche Bank AG, DWS Group, continue to sit on Adani stakes in ESG funds that track indexes offered by MSCI Inc. Spokespeople for JPMorgan and BlackRock declined to comment. A spokesperson for DWS said that when it comes to its MSCI-tracking ETFs, “no proprietary DWS ESG assessment is used,” in an emailed response to questions. MSCI said by email that the results of a regular review of its ESG and climate indexes “will be implemented” at the end of this month. The firm hasn’t adjusted any Adani ESG ratings.The Details.... The JPMorgan Global Emerging Markets Research Enhanced Index Equity ESG UCITS ETF offloaded the more than 70,000 shares in cement manufacturer ACC Ltd., exiting a stake it’s held since May 2021, according to a data review by Bloomberg that looked at movements following the Jan. 24 publication of the Hindenburg report. A second fund, the JPMorgan AC Asia Pacific ex Japan Research Enhanced Index Equity ESG UCITS ETF, sold the roughly 1,350 shares it had held in the company since July last year, the data show. The moves mean JPMorgan, which had held 0.04% in ACC, now has no further exposure to any parts of the Adani conglomerate via ESG funds, according to Bloomberg data.Both funds are registered as Article 8, which under EU rules means they’re required to “promote” ESG goals. JPMorgan continues to hold Adani stocks in non-ESG funds.For many fund managers whose investment decisions aren’t anchored by MSCI indexes, Adani became too toxic to hold after a Jan. 24 report by short-seller Hindenburg Research, which alleged the conglomerate was guilty of fraud and market manipulation. The Adani Group has rejected the claims and hired lawyers and communications specialists in an effort to resurrect its image.For now, the 10 companies that make up the Adani conglomerate are continuing to bleed money, having lost roughly $150 billion in combined market capital since the Hindenburg findings were released, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Tim Buckley, director at Australian think tank Climate Energy Finance, described the investor losses as an “absolute failure” on the part of regulators and index providers.Regulators need to stay on top of “the biggest systemic risks, and to me, one of the big systemic risks is the index funds and the lack of clarity and regulatory definition.”About 500 ESG funds in Europe hold Adani stocks, according to the latest available data compiled by Bloomberg. Most of the holdings are contained in funds registered as Article 8, meaning they’re required to “promote” environmental, social and governance goals under European Union rules. A handful of so-called Article 9 funds, which are required to target 100% sustainable investments, also hold Adani stocks.Funds with at least $10 billion in assets under management tracking MSCI ESG indexes held shares in Adani Enterprises Ltd. alone when the Hindenburg report was published, according to an analysis by the Anthropocene Fixed Income Institute, which has been studying the Adani Group since mid-2020.Though MSCI still holds Adani stocks in its ESG indexes, asset managers such as BlackRock are reducing their exposure to the conglomerate through other indexes. S&P Global Inc. said this month it was removing Adani Enterprises from its Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes. Sustainalytics has downgraded the ESG scores of several Adani companies. MSCI has made no changes to the ESG ratings of Adani companies since the Hindenburg report. Adani Total Gas Ltd. and Adani Green Energy Ltd. both hold an A rating. Three entities — Adani Enterprises Ltd., Adani Power Ltd. and Adani Ports & Special Economic Zone Ltd. — hold MSCI’s lowest ESG rating, CCC. “Many of the Adani companies already performed poorly on corporate governance,” a spokesperson for MSCI said. MSCI has previously assessed a range of ESG controversies tied to Adani, including “community opposition to specific projects and questionable business ties,” the person said. Aside from allegations of fraud and market manipulation, ESG fund managers have also had to digest documentation indicating their green dollars were indirectly financing coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel. Norway’s largest pension fund, KLP, dumped its entire holding of shares in Adani Green Energy Ltd. after the Hindenburg report was published. A Feb. 10 public filing has since made clear that Adani is using stock from companies marketed as “green” as collateral in a credit facility that’s helping to finance the Carmichael coal mine in Australia, via Adani Enterprises Ltd.“Concerns around the use of shares to support loans for sister companies within the Adani Group could hinder funding access and weaken technical support for their dollar bond,” Sharon Chen, a credit analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said in a note. “Adani Group’s complex debt structure and weak transparency, evidenced by the use of Adani Green Energy shares to support its coal unit, could further increase ESG concerns and hinder funding access.”Don’t miss out on ET Prime stories!

While Gill, who emerged as a force to reckon with across formats, has warmed the bench in the first two Tests.Read AlsoSourav Ganguly on KL Rahul: 'If you don't score in India, you will get flak'It will be difficult for KL Rahul to avoid scathing criticism for his protracted poor run because of the enormous expectations attached with the job, especially when past cricketers have set high standards, says former India skipper Sourav Ganguly.Both Rahul and Gill batted simultaneously in adjacent nets during a training session on Monday under the supervision of head coach Rahul Dravid.The cricketing fraternity came up with different opinions after Rahul, who averages an ordinary 33.44 after 47 Tests, failed miserably in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy.Rahul has got an extended run as the team management has immense faith in his abilities but with every failure, the pressure is mounting on the stylish opener.Gill, on the other hand, has had a coming-of-age season across formats and his supporters, which include former cricketers, believe there is no better time to draft him into the playing eleven.While Gill was more attacking in his approach, Rahul bided his time and focused on his defence.Rahul left and blocked the first 18 balls he faced before practicing the aerial hits down the ground off spinners. He then traded places with Gill to face R Ashwin and there also, he looked to play everything with a straight bat.Before batting alongside Rahul, Gill was the first member of the team to hit the nets as other underwent warm-up and fielding drills.After their stint in the main nets, both Gill and Rahul moved to the other side of the ground to face a few throwdowns.Preps 🔛!#TeamIndia get into the groove for the 3⃣rd #INDvAUS Test in Indore 👌 👌@mastercardindia https://t.co/iM7kmmrMLQ— BCCI (@BCCI) 1677480003000Rohit, Kohli bat aggressively in their own wayBoth Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli looked in fine touch in the Delhi Test but were not able to convert starts.Walking into the nets together, the star batters displayed an aggressive approach against the spinners.

Taking a jibe at the AAP leaders, he said: ""It is being reiterated that the Education Minister has been arrested, is it shameful to call him the liquor minister?""

Countering Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal`s allegations over Sisodia`s arrest, the BJP MP said that Kejriwal and Sisodia could cheat humans but not God.
He added that the misery caused to the people of Delhi had become a sin for Sisodia which is why he has been arrested.

Tiwari stated that the Chief Minister is afraid of the scope of the investigation that is likely to increase after the arrest.

Justifying Sisodia`s arrest, the BJP MP said that evidence of crime is found no matter how carefully it has been committed when it occurs under God`s watch, which is exactly what is happening to Sisodia and Kejriwal.

(Screengrab) By India Today Web Desk: A man, who was an accused in the Umesh Pal murder case, was killed in an encounter.   The Special Operations Group of the Uttar Pradesh Police and the district police shot the accused, identified as Arbaz, at the Nehru Park in Prayagraj. 
Umesh Pal, the prime witness in the 2005 BSP MLA Raju Pal murder case, was shot dead on Friday evening at his residence in Uttar Pradesh's Prayagraj. advertisementUmesh Pal was shot dead by an unidentified man while he was getting out of the backseat of a Hyundai Creta SUV in Prayagraj. Pal was rushed to Swaroop Rani Nehru Hospital, where he succumbed during treatment. Pal's autopsy report revealed that he was shot seven times. Following the murder, Umesh Pal's wife Jaya Pal approached Prayagraj police and filed an FIR. A case under relevant sections of the IPC and Explosives Act was registered against former MP Atiq Ahmed's brother, wife Sahista Praveen and his sons Ahzaan and Abaan and several others. BJP leader Rahil Hasan’s brother Ghulam has been named in the murder case of Umesh Pal, following which he was removed from the saffron party. Raju Pal was murdered months after winning the Allahabad (West) assembly seat, in his electoral debut, by defeating former MP Atiq Ahmed's younger brother Khalid Azim. The Uttar Pradesh Police formed 10 teams to look for the attackers and are extensively checking all Prayagraj exit routes, including borders, bus stands, and the airport. So far, the Uttar Pradesh Police have detained over 40 people, including Atiq's relatives, over the murder of Umesh Pal. The Uttar Pradesh Police is all set to question Atiq Khan, who is currently lodged in Ahmedabad's Sabarmati jail, as they believe he hatched the conspiracy to kill Umesh Pal. Meanwhile, Atiq Ahmed's wife Shaista Parveen, wrote a letter to Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath demanding a CBI enquiry in the Umesh Pal murder case. She accused Prayagraj Police Commissioner Ramesh Sharma and ADG STF Amitabh Yash of conniving with opponents and taking contracts for the murder of her husband Atiq Ahmed and Atiq's younger brother Ashraf.  --- ENDS ---

Rakshitha (20) was found hanging from a ceiling fan at her relative`s house at Ramannapet in Warangal town on Sunday night.

Hailing from Bhupalpally, she was a third year B.Tech (ECE) student at an engineering college in Narsampet.

According to police, the girl had a friendship with Jaswant and Rahul, who were her classmates in 10th class. She took the extreme step as they had uploaded some photographs taken in the past on social media.

Police booked against Jaswant and Rahul and formed special teams to apprehend them.

Police clarified that it was not a case of ragging as claimed on social media. A police officer said the two youths were not studying college.

Warangal police were also trying to get the information about the past record of Jaswant and Rahul.
Rahul was allegedly harassing the girl for some time. The family had lodged a complaint with Bhupalapally police, who had summoned the youth and counselled him.

Rakshitha, who had come home at Bhupalapally on Mahashivratri, left for college the next day. However, she did not reach the college and her parents had lodged a missing complaint with the police. Two days later, she returned home.

As she told her father P. Shankar that she was facing difficulties in staying at the hostel, he sent her to his brother`s house at Ramannapet. She was to go to Bhupalapally police station on Monday in connection with the missing case. However, a day before she died by suicide at her uncle`s house.

		            Nifty oversold, can consolidate at 17,200-17,900: AnalystsSECTIONSNifty oversold, can consolidate at 17,200-17,900: AnalystsET BureauLast Updated: Feb 27, 2023, 06:11 AM ISTRate StoryShareFont SizeAbcSmallAbcMediumAbcLargeSavePrintCommentSynopsis​Based on the rollover analysis and chart setup, we expect midcap IT, defence, and CPSE space to outperform with long build-up visible in names such as UltraTech, ONGC, Siemens, IGL and Polycab, and short build-up in banking, oil & gas, metals, auto, and real estate with stocks like M&M, JSW Steel, Jindal Steel, Hindalco, HPCL, Godrej Properties, DLF, and Canara Bank.AgenciesAfter the last six sessions, the sharp decline has approached oversold territory; hence, going short at the current level is not advisableWill the Nifty be able to end its six-day losing run? The index looks oversold in the short-term on technical and derivative fronts, but with the index breaking below the key support of 17,500, analysts are not ruling out further downside. Reliance Industries, TCS, L&T, Axis Bank, NTPC, ONGC, UltraTech, and Maruti are some stocks analysts recommend for short-term trading.SUDEEP SHAH HEAD - TECHNICAL & DERIVATIVE RESEARCH, SBI SECURITIESWhere is the Nifty headed? Technically, the Nifty has witnessed a lower top-lowerbottom formation for the past five trading sessions. The index has also witnessed a breakdown below an important support zone of 17,600, a key support zone formed by an upward sloping trendline joining rising swing bottoms of 15,183 (June 2022) and 17,353 (February 1). This implies a likelihood of further weakness in the coming week. Crucial support is seen at the 200-day moving average of 17,320- 17,340, and a breakdown below this zone could attract further selling towards 17,000. Resistance on the upside is seen at the 17,650-17,700 zone. Above 17,700, the index can revisit the 17,920-17,950 levels. Option chain data show the Nifty is expected to trade in a range of 17,050-17,730. What should investors do? Based on the rollover analysis and chart setup, we expect midcap IT, defence, and CPSE space to outperform with long build-up visible in names such as UltraTech, ONGC, Siemens, IGL and Polycab, and short build-up in banking, oil & gas, metals, auto, and real estate with stocks like M&M, JSW Steel, Jindal Steel, Hindalco, HPCL, Godrej Properties, DLF, and Canara Bank.ARPAN SHAH SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, MONARCH NETWORTH CAPITALWhere is the Nifty headed? The Nifty has closed below the psychological 17,500 level with a negative candlestick formation on the weekly chart. FPIs were net sellers in the cash segment, and their net short position on the index future has reached 82%. Looking at the current oversold positioning on the technical and derivative fronts, we can expect some volatile momentum in the coming week. The index has a strong support level at 17,350 level, which is a budget-day low, and if it holds that level, then we can expect some recovery in the second half of the week. The banking index is also likely to be volatile with support at 39,400 and resistance at 41,000. What should investors do? The metal index has given a fresh breakdown below its support level and can trade with negative bias. Hindalco has closed with bearish candlestick and can reach the Rs 405 level in the coming days. Aditya Birla Fashion is also heading lower towards the Rs 220 level. Among large-caps, Reliance has bounced back from the `2,290 level multiple times in the last few days and is making a higher bottom, heading to Rs 2,500 in the March series. TCS may find support lower, so traders should look to add near Rs 3,350 level. DHARMESH SHAH AVP - TECHNICAL ANALYST, ICICI SECURITIESWhere is Nifty headed? The weekly price action formed a bear candle that engulfed the past three weeks’ gains, indicating corrective bias. However, the index has approached oversold territory after a sharp decline in the last six sessions. It has strong support at 17,200 levels, and we expect it to consolidate in the broad range of 17,200-17,800. However, for a meaningful reversal to be in place, higher high-low on a weekly time frame would be a key monitorable along with improvement in market breadth. What should investors do? After the last six sessions, the sharp decline has approached oversold territory; hence, going short at the current level is not advisable. A key observation on longer degree charts is that since 2008, in each of seven instances of Nifty correcting for three consecutive months, the following month produced an average 5% return. Going by this rhythm, a pullback from the current oversold zone cannot be ruled out. Major sectors to focus on are BFSI, telecom, capital goods, auto, and IT, which are expected to outperform. We prefer Reliance Industries, Larsen & Toubro, Axis Bank, NTPC, ONGC, and Maruti in the large-cap space.Don’t miss out on ET Prime stories!

Speaking to reporters on Monday, Raut alleged that the Centre was trying to silence the Opposition by misusing different agencies to send Opposition leaders to jail or forcing them to surrender.

Raut said, ""Action against Sisodia shows that the Centre is trying to silence the Opposition. We will stand with him (Sisodia). Be it Maharashtra, Jharkhand, or Delhi, the Centre is misusing the ED and the CBI to send Opposition leaders to jail or force them to surrender.""
""This is happening again and again. Be it Sisodia, Nawab Malik, Anil Deshmukh or myself. Are there seers and mahatmas in the BJP?"" Raut questioned. ""What about the cases going on against their leaders? Everyone knows who looted the State Bank of India (SBI), and the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC)...the whole country is asking questions to the government but the PM is silent,"" added Raut.

Extending his support to AAP leaders in the wake of Sisodia`s arrest, Raut said, ""No matter how much you oppress, we will keep fighting. Our party stands with Kejriwal and Sisodia.""

""All these decisions are being taken because of one person. These are not the decisions of the cabinet. If an Opposition leader asks questions, he is put behind bars,"" he added.

The CBI on Sunday arrested Sisodia in connection with the Delhi liquor scam, after eight hours of questioning. Shortly before arriving at the CBI office for questioning, the deputy chief minister said false cases were being lodged against leaders of the ruling party as Prime Minister Narendra Modi was ""afraid"" of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal.Live Tvdelhi liquor policy caseSanjay RautManish SisodiaBJPAAPMore Stories Live updates LIVE Updates | Court Sends Sisodia To CBI Remand Till March 4 BA Student UP Exam Shocker!

Former India captain Sourav Ganguly spoke on the opener's form and said that the criticism was justified.AdvertisementIndia Today Sports DeskNew Delhi,UPDATED: Feb 27, 2023 15:55 ISTKL Rahul has not been in terrible form against Australia in the Border Gavaskar Trophy. (AP Photo)In ShortKL Rahul has been going through a terrible patch of formIndia captain and coach have backed KL Rahul to regain formRahul was dropped from the position of vice-captaincy for the last 2 Test matchesBy India Today Sports Desk: India batter KL Rahul has not been enjoying good form since his return to the Indian team. Rahul, who has not been at his best since mid-2022 was recently dropped from the position of vice-captaincy for the final two matches of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. Former India captain Sourav Ganguly was asked about the criticism on the opening batter. Ganguly, in an interview with news agency PTI said that a batter would be criticised if he was not scoring runs in the home conditions.advertisementRahul hasn't crossed 25-run mark in his last 10 Test knocks. An average of less than 35 in 47 Tests isn't an actual realisation of his real potential.""When you don't score runs in India, obviously you will get flak. KL Rahul hasn't been the only one. There have been players in the past also,"" Ganguly told PTI in an exclusive interview on the sidelines of Delhi Capitals' IPL pre-season camp.Ganguly tried to put things in perspective as to why the Bengaluru man is being persisted with despite repeated failures.""There's so much focus and attention with lot of pressure on players. The team management thinks he is an important player for the team. At the end of the day, what coach and captain thinks is important,"" the veteran of 113 Tests and 311 ODIs said.While Rahul has played some quality knocks in England and Australia, Ganguly said it's obvious that people will expect way more from a talented player like Rahul, who has managed just five Test hundreds in nine years.""He has performed but obviously you expect a lot more from a top order batter playing for India because the standards set by others are so high.""When you fail for a while, obviously there will be criticism. I am sure Rahul has ability and I am sure as and when he gets more opportunities, he will have to find ways to score,"" he explained.--- ENDS ---Also Read |  Beth Mooney's selfless act in Australia's record World Cup triumph: Thought of retiring early in final

		            IPO drought to end in March with nine companies seeking to raise over Rs 17,000 croreSECTIONSIPO drought to end in March with nine companies seeking to raise over Rs 17,000 croreBy Rajesh Mascarenhas, ET BureauLast Updated: Feb 27, 2023, 11:12 AM ISTRate StoryShareFont SizeAbcSmallAbcMediumAbcLargeSavePrintCommentSynopsisJanuary and February did not see any public issues. The high-profile ₹20,000-crore follow-on public offering of Adani Enterprises was called off after a rout in its share price following a Hindenburg report accusing the conglomerate of stock price 'manipulation' and accounting 'fraud'.iStockLast year, 40 companies raised ₹59,302 crore from the primary market through IPOs compared to 63 companies that have raised ₹1.19 lakh crore in 2021, according to Prime Database.Mumbai: The two-month dry spell for the primary market seems to be ending, as nine companies may hit the market in the next four-six weeks to raise more than ₹17,000 crore, bankers said. After a few initial public offerings (IPOs) launched in December struggled to sail through, investors and companies turned cautious amid a weak secondary market.Companies planning to enter the primary market in the next 4-6 weeks, according to bankers, include Avalon Technologies, Capillary Technologies, Cogent Systems, Divgi TorqTransfer Systems, Mankind Pharma, Nexus Malls REIT, Signature Global, TVS Supply Chain, and Utkarsh Small Finance Bank.Eight of the nine companies did not respond to ET's queries, while the spokesperson of Avalon Technologies said they would have more clarity on the issue's timeline in 10 days.January and February did not see any public issues. The high-profile ₹20,000-crore follow-on public offering of Adani Enterprises was called off after a rout in its share price following a Hindenburg report accusing the conglomerate of stock price 'manipulation' and accounting 'fraud'. The Nifty 50 index fell more than 4% since January 1, while Nifty Midcap 150 and Nifty Smallcap 150 indices declined by 5% and 6%, respectively, as foreign portfolio investors sold shares worth ₹28,104 crore during this period.In the past eight months, 33 companies with IPO plans worth ₹49,300 crore have allowed their regulatory approvals to lapse, according to Prime Database numbers.""Diminished investor appetite and an uncertain market outlook had forced many to defer fundraising plans,"" said Dharmesh Mehta, CEO of DAM Capital Advisors. ""However, even in a volatile market like this, there is a demand for selective smaller to mid-size IPOs that are reasonably priced.""Automotive component firm Divgi TorqTransfer Systems is the first company to launch its mainboard maiden public issue in 2023. The IPO will open for subscription on March 1 and close on March 3. The ₹500-crore IPO comprises a fresh issue of ₹180 crore and an offer for sale (OFS) of 3.93 million shares.The public issue of Mankind Pharma, the drug maker known for Manforce Condoms and Prega News, may hit the market at the end of March or the first half of April to raise up to ₹5,000 crore, according to banking sources. The ChrysCapital-backed consortium of GIC of Singapore and CPP Investments owns 10% of Mankind, while Capital International owns another 11% stake. The IPO comprises a fresh issue of up to ₹1,600 crore, according to the draft prospectus.TVS Supply Chain Solutions, a part of Chennai-based conglomerate TVS group, is also exploring launching its public issue in the next 5-6 weeks, bankers told ET. The company plans to mop up at least ₹4,000 crore from the market. The IPO consists of a fresh issue of shares worth ₹2,000 crore and an offer-for-sale of up to 59.5 million shares.Chennai-based Avalon Technologies, an IT services and solutions company, and Gurugram-based real estate company Signature Global are also planning to respectively raise ₹850 crore and ₹1,000 crore each in March.Last year, 40 companies raised ₹59,302 crore from the primary market through IPOs compared to 63 companies that have raised ₹1.19 lakh crore in 2021, according to Prime Database.Don’t miss out on ET Prime stories!

		            Rare-Naman leads race for Rajesh Lifespaces' hotel armSECTIONSRare-Naman leads race for Rajesh Lifespaces' hotel armBy Joel Rebello, ET BureauLast Updated: Feb 27, 2023, 12:20 AM ISTRate StoryShareFont SizeAbcSmallAbcMediumAbcLargeSavePrintCommentSynopsisThe consortium's offer of ₹461 crore upfront with another ₹31 crore in equity in the company is likely to be declared as the top bid by bankers next week, following which it will be put to vote, people aware of the development told ET.Lenders to real estate developer Rajesh Lifespaces' hospitality arm are likely to name the consortium of Rare Asset Reconstruction Co and Naman Group as the preferred bidder for the takeover of the company's defunct hotel business in Mumbai.The consortium's offer of ₹461 crore upfront with another ₹31 crore in equity in the company is likely to be declared as the top bid by bankers next week, following which it will be put to vote, people aware of the development told ET.""Rare has tied up with Check-Inn, which is a part of the Mumbai-based Naman Group and has a stake in Sofitel (Sofitel Hotels India) and some other hotels in Mumbai and Thane,"" said one of the people cited earlier. ""They are the only ones who have shown ₹480 crore in cash in their bank account earmarked for this acquisition, which is a big reason why they are the favourite.""ICICI Bank has the largest exposure to the company at ₹331 crore, followed by Bank of Baroda (₹162 crore) and Union Bank of India (₹128 crore). Their exposure is in the form of external commercial borrowings and bank guarantees. Lead lender ICICI Bank did not respond to ET's request for comment.After 13 rounds of bidding, the banks last week shortlisted three bidders - Ahmedabad-based hospitality and restaurant group Sankalp Recreation, Kolkata's Shri Ram Multicom, and Rare ARC.Sankalp's offer was the highest at ₹533 crore, but a majority of the payment is deferred - it'll be paid 300 days after the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) gives its approval. Also, Sanklap has so far not been able to detail its source of funds, which has made banks wary.Shri Ram Multicom's ₹474 crore offer is also payable after 90 days.""The Rare-Check-Inn consortium also has tangible cash flows, is better rated and, more importantly, has also proposed to bear any additional costs after the resolution, which is why it has an edge,"" the person cited earlier said.The defunct hotel in Mumbai's Powai locality owes about ₹6 crore to the municipal corporation and also will need further investments to complete the building, for which the Rare-Naman group consortium has committed an additional ₹250 crore.The committee of creditors has hired Resurgent Resolution Professionals to compare all three plans based on a performance matrix and net present value (NPV). The report will be given to the lenders and a vote will be called, most likely next week.Rare ARC had initially bid for the hotel on its own but later tied up with Check-Inn, which also helped increase its net worth to more than ₹1,000 crore, which is the minimum required for ARCs bidding for assets under the bankruptcy process, as per Reserve Bank of India norms.In November last year, the lenders had received some 26 expressions of interest from entities to take over the debt-laden hotel.Interest in the hotel has been strong because Mumbai's Powai locality doesn't have any five-star or mid-market hotels. Also, the rebound in leisure and business travel after the Covid outbreak has whetted the appetite of potential buyers. Lenders had called for an online challenger bid auction this month after several bidders showed interest in the asset. Don’t miss out on ET Prime stories!

What's fueling the buyer interest in uber luxury apartments?NEW DELHI: Passengers flying Air India will soon get the much-awaited decent cabin product as the back-in-Tata-fold airline will refurbish its entire wide body fleet in 2024 apart from inducting new aircraft starting this year. Six Airbus A350s (that were meant for Aeroflot but due to sanctions can’t be delivered to Russia) will join AI fleet this year. Five ex-Delta Boeing 777s have begun flying on North America routes. A $400-million cabin refurbishment programme for the existing wide body fleet — where passenger current pain points like seats, carpets and inflight entertainment (IFE) systems will be changed — has been launched and will be implemented next year. Premium class IFEs are now almost all functional and a massive longhaul network expansion is on the cards, especially in North America and Europe.On their part, flyers will also do well to behave themselves as the Maharaja has now got strict with unruly passengers and is reporting all such cases for action after the recent infamous urination incidents where it was blamed by the aviation regulator for not taking the required action and even trying to hush up the cases. “Almost everyday we see instances where inebriated passengers misbehave. Very often people come on board after having a few drinks and some consume their own alcohol bought from duty free onboard. The crew faces their ire in the form of threats and even assaults when they refuse to serve more liquor to such passengers. We are reporting all such cases now,” AI MD-CEO Campbell Wilson said on Monday.He spoke to the media for the first time after the Tatas placed a record firm order for 470 aircraft along with an option for 370 more. Such a large induction requires preparations on all front — from financial to personnel. The Tatas had last January taken over AI and AI Express — with the two airlines not seeing any investment on cabin product or fresh hiring in their last few penurious years as state-owned airlines.Since 2022, over 20 planes that had been grounded for years are back in the air and capacity has increased by 78%, says Wilson. A mismatch in the number of planes in service and crew available is often seeing long haul flights getting cancelled. Then the airline has rolled out a voluntary retirement scheme opted for by 1,500 employees — 43% of eligible staff — which added to the shortage. Clearly, seamlessly inducting hundreds of planes would require massive preparations to avoid the crunch being witnessed currently.“There has been learning along the way. We are hiring 500 cabin crew every month and have a strong pipeline of personnel. A crew academy is in the works that will train personnel not just for AI but other airlines too,” Wilson said. AI will also hire expat crew members to expedite growth and try to attract the sizeable number of Indian pilots and cabin crew working in foreign airlines — especially in the Gulf.Delivery of the 470 firm order of aircraft — valued at $70 billion at list price — will begin this year with six A350s and continue till the end of this decade. “We will finance this order though a several modes. There will be equity, sale and lease back and other financing options.” In some years, AI will need to take a call on converting the option for 370 more planes into firm orders as it will retire its old Airbus A320s and Boeing-777 200 long range in the next four to five years.“The process for merging budget Air India Express with erstwhile AirAsia India is on which should be completed in a few months. Soon after that, subject to regulatory approvals, we will merge Vistara into AI. Key features of Vistara, which established itself as a premium airline in past few years, will be retained in AI,” Wilson said. The PSU work culture is being corporatised to put a premium on performance.While Bobby Kooka’s loveable Maharaja will remain, Tatas have also hired global brand transformation company FutureBrand to finalise the look and feel of the new Air India. “Maharaja is one of the many strong assets we will like to retain. The new image of AI must reflect the image of new India to appeal to all (beyond Indians and the huge Indian Diaspora across the world),” he said.Start a ConversationFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIAFacebookTwitterInstagramKOO APPYOUTUBE Visual Stories  Shilpa Shetty's mesmerising saree looks that won the internet!EntertainmentShilpa Shetty channels her inner 'apsara' in sheer white sareeindiaRashmika Mandanna stuns in off-shoulder dressindiaLiza Golden-Bhojwani channels her inner diva during the photoshootindiaHappy Birthday, Sunny Singh: Pretty pics of the actressEntertainmentIN PICS: Asim Riaz’s uber-cool lookstvPants to kissing device: Bizarre devices you can connect to the wi-fiLifestyle8 dishes from Meghalaya that are pure delightFoodSunny Leone stuns in lehengasEntertainment123ElectionsErode Election LiveNagaland Election 2023 LiveBypolls 2023 LiveMeghalaya Election 2023 LiveNagaland Exit PollsTripura Election ResultMeghalaya Exit PollsNagaland Election ResultsTop TrendingErode Bypoll LiveTejas ExpressShivamogga AirportMeghalaya Election 2023Manish Sisodia ArrestNagaland Election 2023Trending StoriesIn BusinessEntire WebsiteSeeing almost daily cases of unruly flyers & reporting all: Air India CEOEssar launches $3.6 billion transition armITC’s climb to a record high shows investor hunt for stability amid Adani woesAir India has 'enormous' potential: CEO Campbell WilsonFabindia shelves $482 million IPO due to rough market conditionsProtect your EV with electric vehicle insuranceISB's Chief Digital Officer ProgrammeChancellor Scholz to Indian techies: Consider working in GermanyAsian shares track Wall Street decline on hot economic dataEPFO members can apply for higher pension till May 3Live: CBI seeks 5-day custody of Delhi deputy CM Manish Sisodia in liquor policy caseHow future citizens of US are being planned in north Gujarat‘Cost of a blood test can come down to Rs 10’Cong may delay Rahul’s K'taka assembly poll campaignShivamogga: Lotus-shaped airport inaugurated todaySeeing unruly flyers almost daily & reporting all: Air India CEOWhy Pakistan will go Afghanistan way, not Sri LankaJewar airport will have five runways instead of twoParticipate in the Times EdTech SurveyWatch: How PM celebrated BSY's birthday in Shivamoggaother calculatorsSIP CalculatorA SIP calculator is a simple tool that allows individuals to get an idea of the returns on theirCalculate NowPPF CalculatorThis financial tool allows one to resolve their queries related to Public Provident Fund account.Calculate NowFD CalculatorWhen investing in a fixed deposit, the amount you deposit earns interest as per the prevailing...Calculate NowNPS CalculatorThe National Pension System or NPS is a measure to introduce a degree of financial stability...Calculate NowMutual Fund CalculatorMutual Funds are one of the most incredible investment strategies that offer better returns...Calculate Now12345About usCreate Your Own AdTerms of Use and Grievance Redressal Policy Privacy policyAdvertise with usRSSNewsletterFeedbackePaperSitemapArchivesFOLLOW US ONOther Times Group News SitesThe Economic TimesHindi Economic TimesNavbharat TimesMaharashtra TimesVijaya KarnatakaTelugu SamayamTamil SamayamMalayalam SamayamEi SamayI am GujaratTimesPointsIndiatimesBrand CapitalEducation TimesTimes FoodMiss KyraMumbai MirrorBangalore MirrorPopular CategoriesHeadlinesSports NewsBusiness NewsIndia NewsWorld NewsBollywood NewsHealth & Fitness TipsIndian TV ShowsCelebrity PhotosHot on the WebK Vishwanaths Death NewsHrithik RoshanHoney GingerBollywood CouplesBaby NamesRakhi SawantSachin Shroff WeddingVastu TipsRakesh SujathasShehnaaz GillTop TrendsErode Bypoll LiveTejas ExpressShivamogga AirportMeghalaya Election 2023Manish Sisodia ArrestNagaland Election 2023India vs AustraliaAiden MarkramBypolls 2023 LiveShivmogga Airport InaugurationNEET PG 2023CBSE Board Exam 2023Bank Holidays in MarchMeghalaya Election Exit PollsNagaland Election Exit PollsTripura Election ResultCryptocurrency Price in IndiaIPL Schedule 2023Trending TopicsParineeti ChopraParenting TipsRelationships TipsShark Tank India 2Rich Dosa RecipesGondola Rides In VeniceOld FridgeMushroom BenefitsSAG Awards 2023Heart DiseasesBest Food For HealthGenelia D'SouzaBollywood Actor TransformationsShanthi PriyaAlia BhattBollywood CelebritiesVivo Y55sLaptops under 30000WiFi RoutersTablets under 15000Living and entertainmentiDivaMensXP.comFeminaETimesGraziaZoomTravel DestinationsBombay TimesCricbuzz.comFilmfareOnline SongsTVLifestyleLongwalks AppNewspaper SubscriptionFood NewsTimes PrimeWhats HotServicesCouponDuniaMagicbricksTechGigTimesJobsBollywood NewsTimes MobileGadgets NowCareersColombiaCopyright © 2023 Bennett, Coleman & Co.

Remarks against PM: SC extends protection from coercive action to Congress leader Pawan Khera till March 3
— Press Trust of India (@PTI_News) February 27, 2023

 

The Supreme Court had on Thursday issued a notice to Assam and the UP Police over the Congress leader's plea seeking clubbing of FIRs and granted him interim protection from arrest. The Supreme Court further directed the Dwaraka Court to release the petitioner on interim bail till the next date of hearing.

The top court passed the order while hearing a plea challenging Congress leader Pawan Khera's arrest in connection with his alleged insulting statements on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's father. Khera had earlier moved the Supreme Court seeking relief in multiple FIRs lodged against him in Assam, and Uttar Pradesh's Lucknow and Varanasi. Senior advocate A M Singhvi, who appeared for Khera in the matter which was listed before a bench headed by Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud, sought interim relief for the Congress leader and consolidation of FIRs since several are being registered across the country. Singhvi told the Supreme Court that Khera had apologised and said that it was a mistake, a slip of tongue.
Khera was arrested on Thursday morning at the Delhi airport after being deplaned from a flight to Raipur in connection with his alleged remarks against Modi at the request of Assam Police.

During the hearing, Singhvi told the bench that multiple FIRs have been lodged against Khera over his alleged remarks against the prime minister. ""He (Khera) has made statements in a press conference. He has made certain statements which I cannot say in the court but I personally would not have made,"" Singhvi said.

He said due to the statements, multiple FIRs have been lodged against Khera in different states and, currently, Assam Police are at the airport to take him into custody. Khera, against whom a case has been registered in Assam, was asked by the Delhi Police to deplane. Congress leaders accompanying him sat on the tarmac in protest and resisted efforts to take him away without an arrest warrant.

Senior Delhi Police officials later handed over a document from Assam Police seeking their help in arresting Khera. Congress leader Randeep Surjewala accompanied Khera to a police station at the airport where there was a huge deployment of CISF. Pawan Khera was arrested under various sections of 120B/153A/153B/500/504/505/502, which includes criminal conspiracy and inciting communal disharmony.
Pawan Khera recently referred to the Prime Minister as ""Narendra Gautamdas Modi"" while criticising the Central government over the row involving the business conglomerate headed by Gautam Adani. The ruling party has accused him of making fun of the prime minister and his late father.

PM's Modi's full name is Narendra Damodardas Modi, with the middle name Damodardas standing for his father's name, a common practice in many parts of the country.Live TvPawan Kherapawan khera arrestPawan Khera Modi RemarksSupreme CourtNarendra Gautam Das ModiCongressPawan Khera FIRspawan khera latest newsMore Stories Live updates LIVE Updates | Court Sends Sisodia To CBI Remand Till March 4 BA Student UP Exam Shocker!

Currently, the share is a low 4 per cent, Kamath told PTI in an interaction over the weekend.Digital sector can contribute 25% GDP by the time India becomes a $7 trillion economy: KV KamathMumbai, Noted banker KV Kamath, who now chairs the National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development (NaBFID), expects the digital sector to contribute a quarter of the incremental GDP by the time the economy becomes a USD 7 trillion giant by FY29. Currently, the contribution of the digital economy is a low 4 per cent, whereas it is as much as 40 per cent in China.  The government and planners see the economy becoming the third largest in the world by FY29, overtaking Japan, with a GDP of USD 7 trillion from the present USD 3.3 trillion.  The digital economy -- the digital infrastructure, e-commerce and other digital payments and services segments--can be the country's biggest growth-driver and can contribute as much as 25 per cent of the incremental GDP by the time India becomes a USD 7-trillion economy by FY29. Currently, the share is a low 4 per cent, Kamath told PTI in an interaction over the weekend.  ""As much as 40 per cent of the Chinese economy come from the digital sector today, and I don't see any reason why we can't achieve this,"" the former ICICI Bank chairman quipped.  The chairman of NaBFID, the newest development finance institution funded by the government, does not see any reason to stop pushing infrastructure investments as the economy has lot more appetite for more expressways, highways, airports, seaports, and high-speed railheads, discounting a question whether he sees any room for an encore of the banking crisis that befell on lenders after the government push on infrastructure during FY06-08.  ""The economy has more appetite for infrastructure and we still have a lot to do on the key infrastructure sectors of transport such as expressways, highways, airports, seaports, and high-speed railway networks. I would say on roads, we've to have more and more expressways going forward, large airports and dedicated high-speed railheads for both goods as well as passengers,"" Kamath said.  ""More important, we can have more urban rejuvenation projects. Why to limit this to the top cities alone? Let's build more world class cities and also upgrade the existing ones,"" he said.  The economy will need more expressways, more airports and seaports to handle the demand of an economy that will be doubling from the present size to be the third largest with a USD7 trillion GDP over the next five years, he explained.  He also does not see the asset quality of banks imploding again as happened in the last leg of the past decade as most of the infra companies went bust due to their excessive debt-driven expansion.  When pointed out that the highly talked about NPA resolution -- from over 12 per cent to under-5 per cent now--come with a heavy cost on banks, having written off close to Rs 13 lakh crore since the IBC came into force as the recovery has been less than 30 per cent so far, Kamath said whatever progress has been made so far is the topping and as ""we move forward and as the IBC system improves, there will be more incremental gains.""  On the funding part, he said, though banks will continue to remain an integral part of infra funding, there is a need to look at more sources that offer longer term funds.  The NHAI has made a very good beginning with asset monetization through InVits. The whole infra segment, including the railways, should move into the monetization model and this is the most secure way of fundraising, he said.  On the digital front, Kamath said, the NaBFID is actively looking to fund key areas in this space such as data centres , smart cities etc.  The NaBFID was set up in 2021 with an Act of Parliament with Rs 20,000 crore capital and it made the first lending with a Rs 520 crore loan to the Banihal Qazigund Road Tunnel project in J&K in December. The company expects to do around Rs 15,000 crore of funding by the end of this fiscal.Don’t miss out on ET Prime stories! Get your daily dose of business updates on WhatsApp. click here!In Video:

At the end of the day, what coach and captain thinks is important,"" the veteran of 113 Tests and 311 ODIs said.KL Rahul (IANS Photo)While Rahul has played some quality knocks in England and Australia, Ganguly said it's obvious that people will expect way more from a talented player like Rahul, who has managed just five Test hundreds in nine years.""He has performed but obviously you expect a lot more from a top order batter playing for India because the standards set by others are so high.""When you fail for a while, obviously there will be criticism. I am sure Rahul has ability and I am sure as and when he gets more opportunities, he will have to find ways to score,"" he explained.So is Rahul's problem technical or mental? ""Both,"" pat comes the reply.KL Rahul (AFP Photo)But the former BCCI President also gave an interesting insight into Rahul's lack of runs as he is getting out to pacers as well as spinners in all conditions in recent times.""It also makes it hard if you are playing on these sort of pitches as the balls are turning and bouncing. There's uneven bounce and when you are not in form, it makes it even more harder.""SHUBMAN HAS TO WAITThere has been a clamour to include Shubman Gill in the playing XI but Ganguly feels that the Punjab man will get his share of chances and there's no harm if he has to wait a little bit.But what do you tell a Shubman, who has to cool his heels when he is in red hot form?""I am sure when his time comes, he will also get a lot of opportunities. I think the selectors, the captain and the coach think of him and rate him very highly. That's why he is playing ODIs and T20Is, and he has performed as well.""But at the present moment, perhaps message from team management is that he has to wait.""Shubman Gill (IANS Photo)While India have cantered to victories in both the Tests, the top order batters except Rohit Sharma have flattered to deceive with none getting a fifty.Is the concept of dominant batters against spinners sounding too alien nowadays? ""I don't think so. These are very tough wickets. I saw in the first two Tests and it's not easy boss. Playing Ashwin, Jadeja, Lyon and the new guy Todd Murphy, it is never easy with odd ball turning square. There is unevenness, there is everything happening for spinners.""THIS IS NOT STEVE WAUGH'S TEAMIndia have won two Test matches in a cumulative duration of five days of cricket and Ganguly isn't surprised.""India is a different beast in India. They are a pretty good team all around but in India they are pretty hard to beat. When it starts turning, they are a better side than anyone,"" he was sharp in his response.Is the scoreline of 4-0 a real possibility for India?(Photo by Robert Cianflone/Getty Images)""I think so. I don't know how Australia can stop it,"" he was practical while assessing Australia's performance.""The problem is, we keep comparing this Australian team from the teams of the past and it's not the same. You don't have a Matthew Hayden, Justin Langer, Ricky Ponting, Steve and Mark Waugh, (Adam) Gilchrist, you name them. You don't have that quality.""Steve Smith is a great player. (David) Warner hasn't got going, (Marnus) Labuschagne is a good player but these are tough conditions for him as well.""The mistake we make with Australian teams is that we think they are Steve Waugh's Australia but that's not the case. Different players get tested differently in different conditions.""BEEN IN TOUCH WITH PANTGanguly is the Director of Cricket for the Delhi Capitals and one of the toughest challenges for him is to fill in the void created due to unavailability of Rishabh Pant, who met with a horrific accident and underwent surgery recently.""I spoke to him a couple of times. Obviously he is going through a tough period, through injuries and surgeries and I wish him well. In a year's time or may be in a couple of years' time, he will be back playing for India,"" Ganguly's voice had a tinge of sadness as he spoke about a player he has been very fond of.Will he like to see Pant being with the team for some time during IPL which could also help in his recovery.Sourav Ganguly and Rishabh Pant ""Don't know. We will see,"" Ganguly said.DC is yet to announce Pant's replacement and Ganguly is still undecided on who is better between young turk Abhishek Porel and domestic veteran Sheldon Jackson.""We still need a bit of time to figure out. The next camp starts before IPL.""While David Warner is set to lead DC, Axar Patel will be his deputy this season.Ganguly monitored a three-day camp in Kolkata which the likes of Prithvi Shaw, Ishant Sharma, Chetan Sakariya, Manish Pandey attended along with other domestic players.""The IPL is still a month away and the season has just started. It is difficult to get all the players together for the amount of cricket they play. There are four or five who are playing Irani Trophy. Sarfaraz has an injured finger and it's not a broken finger. He should be okay for the IPL,"" he concluded.

India NewsNDTV News DeskUpdated: February 27, 2023 6:07 pm ISTNew Delhi: 
																								Delhi's Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia will be in CBI custody till March 4 for questioning, a Delhi court has ordered. Mr Sisodia was arrested yesterday in connection with alleged corruption in the now-withdrawn liquor policy of Delhi. 										Here's your 10-Point cheatsheet in this big story:The agency told a Delhi court that Manish Sisodia has been giving evasive replies to their questions and failed to explain at least six contentious provisions in the liquor policy that were not part of the first draft. The agency contends that the changes were made at the behest of a liquor lobby in exchange for kickbacks to the tune of Rs 30 crore.A draft note was recovered from the computer of Mr Sisodia, which shows that the profit margin clause for was changed from 5 per cent to 12 per cent. Investigation revealed that Mr Sisodia gave the draft note to the excise commissioner after removing the opinion of the legal expert from it, the agency has alleged.Senior advocate Dayan Krishnan, who represented Mr Sisodia, questioned if the inability to answer the CBI's questions can be a ground for remand. ""Their case is that I did not confess. They expect me to answer the way they want. There cannot be self-incrimination,"" he said.He has also argued that the liquor policy was signed off by the Lieutenant Governor in May 2021. ""What the CBI is trying to hide here is… LG gave suggestions and even those suggestions were also accepted and included before implementation,"" the advocate said.Aam Aadmi Party workers and supporters, meanwhile, hit the streets in Delhi, Bengaluru, Chandigarh, Bhopal, and other cities to protest against Mr Sisodia's arrest. In a tweet, AAP alleged that ""PM Modi's Police forcibly enter the AAP office to arrest AAP volunteers"" and called it an ""Emergency-like situation"".Chaotic scenes were witnessed near the BJP headquarters in New Delhi as police detained several of the protesters. As AAP protestors tried to march towards the BJP office in Delhi, the police blocked their way. Several protesters who tried to climb the barricades were detained. Visuals from the spot showed the police personnel shoving AAP workers into 10-15 buses.Manish Sisodia faces corruption allegations in bringing a new liquor sale policy in the national capital. The CBI contends that liquor companies had involved in drafting parts of the 2021 policy, for which kickbacks were paid by a liquor lobby it dubbed the ""South Group"".The Central Bureau of Investigation arrested Mr Sisodia yesterday after questioning him for eight hours. Mr Sisodia spent the night at the CBI headquarters of the in Delhi. A team of doctors from AIIMS conducted a medical examination of the AAP leader at the CBI headquarters due to security reasons.""I am told that most CBI officers were against Manish's arrest. All of them have huge respect for him and there is no evidence against him. But the political pressure to arrest him was so high that they had to obey their political masters,"" Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted this morning.Almost all opposition parties except the Congress have slammed the arrest of Mr Sisodia. The Delhi unit of the Congress, which is in direct competition with the Aam Aadmi Party, has supported the arrest and said Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal should be arrested next as he is the ""mastermind"" of the alleged liquor scam. Post a comment Also Read""Attack On Democracy"": Kerala's Pinarayi Vijayan On Manish Sisodia ArrestKCR's Daughter ""Will Be Arrested Soon"" In Liquor Policy Case: BJP LeaderTraffic Hit In Parts Of Delhi As AAP Protests Manish Sisodia's ArrestTrack Latest News Live on NDTV.com and get news updates from India  and around the world.

		            India, UK finance ministers agree to make further progress on FTASECTIONSIndia, UK finance ministers agree to make further progress on FTAPTILast Updated: Feb 25, 2023, 11:15 PM ISTRate StoryShareFont SizeAbcSmallAbcMediumAbcLargeSavePrintCommentSynopsis""At a meeting with Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, both sides agreed to make further progress on the UK-India Free Trade Agreement and deepen bilateral economic and financial ties,"" the Treasury department said in a statement.iStockRepresentative ImageIndia and the UK have agreed to make further progress on the ongoing negotiations for a free trade agreement (FTA) and also to swiftly organise the next bilateral Economic and Financial Dialogue soon, the British government said on Saturday. At the conclusion of UK Chancellor Jeremy Hunt's India visit for the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors meeting, held under India's 2023 Presidency, the UK's Treasury department said the finance minister held talks with Indian counterpart Nirmala Sitharaman with a focus on deepening bilateral economic and financial ties.  ""At a meeting with Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, both sides agreed to make further progress on the UK-India Free Trade Agreement and deepen bilateral economic and financial ties,"" the Treasury department said in a statement.  ""They agreed to make swift progress on setting up the next UK-India Economic and Financial Dialogue,"" it said.  Hunt, on his first international visit as UK Chancellor, also met with business leaders in Bengaluru and visited the offices of tech multinational Wipro which employs over 4,000 people in the UK.  ""Meeting fellow Finance Ministers face to face is an excellent opportunity to make real progress on the key global economic issues of our time,"" said Hunt.  ""I first visited India 38 years ago, and it's been fascinating to see how much the country has changed in this time - there are positive lessons to be learnt from their successful rapid development.  ""It's been great to hear from Indian technology business leaders here in Bengaluru how they are pushing the country's economy forward, and I look forward to further collaboration between India and the UK as we continue to trade and create jobs - delivering on the government's plan to grow the economy,"" he said.  The Chancellor, alongside Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey, attended a meeting of G7 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors on Thursday. They were joined virtually by Ukrainian Finance Minister Serhiy Marchenko.  ""Their statement sent a strong message of condemnation for Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine, announced an increase of financial support for the Ukrainian government to a total of USD 39 billion in 2023 and committed to continue supporting vulnerable countries hardest hit by the economic impact of the war,"" the Treasury said.  On Friday, the UK announced a fresh wave of internationally coordinated sanctions and trade measures, to ""further restrict Russia's capability to wage war in Ukraine both now and in the future"".  At the first G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors meeting under the Indian Presidency, Hunt condemned ""Russia's brutal acts"" in the strongest terms, emphasising that securing peace was the most important action for global growth.  According to the UK government, the senior Cabinet minister also underscored the need for bilateral official creditors and private sector to urgently help address low and middle-income country debt vulnerabilities in developing countries.  The minister emphasised the importance of multilateral development banks boosting lending from their existing balance sheets and called on the G20 to fulfil its pledge to channel USD 100 billion of IMF Special Drawing Rights in support of developing countries.  ""The Indian Presidency issued a Chair's statement at the end of the meeting which highlighted, among other things, the continued need to fight inflation, and the importance of supply-side policies, especially those that increase labour supply, boost growth and alleviate price pressures.  ""There was also G20 consensus, including China, on the need for swift resolution of existing debt restructuring cases and to work on the impacts of food and energy insecurity on the global economy,"" the Treasury said.  While in Bengaluru, the UK Chancellor is also said to have had ""productive bilateral meetings"" with US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, French Minister of Economy and Finance Bruno Le Maire and Kristalina Georgieva, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). He also met with Australian Treasurer Jim Chalmers.  While speaking at the meetings, the Chancellor is said to have set out the UK government's intention to protect the most vulnerable from cost-of-living pressures, whilst maintaining fiscal sustainability with debt falling and not adding to inflationary pressure.  He added that the upcoming Spring Budget of the Rishi Sunak-led government on March 15 will ""drive economic growth, focusing on skills, business and infrastructure investment and research and innovation, as well as reviewing regulations of the UK's key growth industries"".Don’t miss out on ET Prime stories!

How much money was received as kickbacks in total?What’s your relationship with businessmen Amit Arora, Dinesh Arora and Arjun Pandey?What discussions were held with excise commissioner and two other excise officials pertaining to framing of policy?Did you use multiple phones, many of them in another person’s name, during the commission of alleged crime?Was approval of competent authority taken?What CBI’s FIR allegesDeputy CM Manish Sisodia, excise commissioner Arva Gopi Krishna, deputy commissioner Anand Tiwari and assistant commissioner Pankaj Bhatnagar were instrumental in recommending and taking decisions pertaining to excise policy for the year 2021-22 without approval of competent authority, and with an intention to extend undue favours to the licencees after tender.Liquor businessmen Amit Arora, Dinesh Arora and Arjun Pandey are close associates of Manish Sisodia and actively involved in managing and diverting undue pecuniary advantage collected from liquor licensees to accused public servants.Fresh findings by CBIThe profit margin for wholesalers was 5% in earlier policy and Group of Ministers’ (GoM)draft. This was increased to 12% on south lobby's demandReports of the expert committee on excise policy were completely changed by constituting a GoM in a calculated manner by concealing an earlier note from council of ministers in support of the expert committee.A crucial file was missing.‘South lobby’ allegedly paid kickbacks.A top excise official was pressured into toeing the line.Major projects being handled by Sisodia- Budget 2023-24- Rozgaar Budget schemes– Start-up policy, food truckpolicy, redevelopment of iconicmarkets, revamp of food - hubs,cloud kitchens, electronic city,Dilli Bazaar portal, RozgaarBazaar 2.0, green jobs throughsolar policy, among others.- G20 preparations- Construction of new school buildings, Schools of Excellence,teachers training abroad.- Construction of newhospitals, e-health cardfor every citizen, freepathological tests forsenior citizens.- Redevelopment of500km of roads as perEuropean standard.- New excise policyPortfolios handled by SisodiaFinance;

She also charged at the Samajwadi Party, terming Atiq Ahmed its 'product'.

""There are reports about the registration of an FIR against Atiq Ahmed's son and his wife in connection with the murder of lawyer Umesh Pal, an important witness in the Raju Pal murder case in Prayagraj, and his gunner. The BSP has taken serious cognisance of this. The BSP has decided that Shaista Parveen, wife of Atiq Ahmed, will be expelled from the party as soon as she is proved guilty in the ongoing investigation of this matter,"" Mayawati said in a tweet in Hindi.


2.बीएसपी ने इसका गम्भीरता से संज्ञान लेते हुये यह निर्णय लिया है कि इस मामले की चल रही जाँच में, इनके दोषी साबित होते ही फिर श्रीमति शाइस्ता परवीन, पत्नी अतीक अहमद, को पार्टी से जरूर निष्कासित कर दिया जायेगा। 2/4
— Mayawati (@Mayawati) February 27, 2023

""It is also well known that Atiq Ahmed is the product of Samajwadi Party, the party where he became MP and MLA, etc. And now Raju Pal's wife has also gone from the BSP to the SP, the party she used to blame earlier. Therefore, under this guise, it is not right to do any politics under,"" she said.

""It is also known that the BSP does not punish any innocent person for the crime committed by his or her family or community. It is also true that the party does not promote criminal elements of any caste or religion,"" Mayawati added.


4. इसके साथ ही, यह भी विदित है कि किसी भी अपराध की सजा, बीएसपी द्वारा, उनके परिवार व समाज के किसी भी निर्दाेष व्यक्ति को नहीं दी जाती है, किन्तु यह भी सच है कि पार्टी किसी भी जाति व धर्म के आपराधिक तत्व को बढ़ावा भी नहीं देती है। 4/4

Umesh Pal, the prime witness in the 2005 BSP MLA Raju Pal murder case, was shot dead in Prayagraj on February 24. One of his gunners, who too was hit during the firing, died later.

The main accused in the Raju Pal murder case is mafia-turned-politician Atiq Ahmed, currently lodged in a Gujarat jail.

On the basis of a complaint lodged by Umesh Pal's wife Jaya Pal, a case was registered at Dhoomanganj police station (in Prayagraj) against Atiq Ahmed, his brother Ashraf, wife Shaista Parveen, two sons, aides Guddu Muslim and Gulam and nine others.

They were booked under sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 302 (murder), 307 (attempt to murder), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the 
Indian Penal Code and provisions of the Explosive Substances Act and the Criminal Law Amendment Act.
Jaya Pal had alleged that her husband was the prime witness in the Raju Pal murder case. In 2006, Atiq Ahmed and his aides had allegedly abducted him and forced him to give a statement in court in their favour.

Sisodia is not only crucial to the Delhi government's functioning, but also the face of the reforms initiated by the Kejriwal-led government.AdvertisementIndia Today News DeskNew Delhi,UPDATED: Feb 27, 2023 17:29 ISTDelhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia on way to Rajghat in New Delhi ahead of his arrest by the CBI on Sunday (Photo: PTI Photo)By India Today News Desk: Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia is a leader who has often been photographed in classrooms, interacting with students. ""Don’t think that if Manish chacha is going to jail, holidays in schools have started,"" Manish Sisodia, who is the education minister of Delhi, said in an emotional appeal to students ahead of his arrest on Sunday.  advertisementThe performance of students from government schools in Delhi and the smart classrooms, which even parents who send their kids to private schools get a peek into while voting in schools turned into polling booths, are tom-tomed by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) while seeking votes in other states.   Apart from education, Manish Sisodia is a man helming 17 other portfolios in the Delhi government. He is also Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's most-trusted lieutenant. Not only is Sisodia key to the Delhi government's functioning, he is also the face of the reforms initiated by the Kejriwal government in Delhi.ALSO READ: Delhi liquor scam: How Arvind Kejriwal govt has plunged into crisis after Manish Sisodia's arrestThat is why Manish Sisodia's arrest by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Sunday night is seen as a body blow not just for the Kejriwal-led Delhi government but for the Aam Aadmi Party and its aspirations for growth as an influential national player.Ironically, Manish Sisodia's portfolios were expanded after his Cabinet colleague Satyendar Jain was arrested on allegations of money laundering in May last year.Sisodia is also facing the heat over Delhi government's Feedback Unit (FBU), which has allegedly been involved in political snooping. The Ministry of Home Affairs last week gave its sanction to prosecute Manish Sisodia under the Prevention of Corruption Act in the Feedback Unit (FBU) snooping case. Sisodia heads the Delhi government's Vigilance Department under which the FBU was created. ALSO READ: Delhi's own Snoopgate? What is the Feedback Unit and the charges against Manish SisodiaManish Sisodia is the most prominent face of AAP after its convenor Arvind Kejriwal. The timing of Sisodia's arrest couldn't have come at a worse time. The AAP is trying to contest the polls in Karnataka, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, and Rajasthan.After gaining control of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD), it has also thrown its hat into the ring for the BMC election. The BMC, the civic body of Mumbai, is the country's wealthiest civic body.The AAP had recently fought the Gujarat Assembly election after fighting the Himachal Pradesh polls and coming to power in Punjab in a landslide last year.advertisementALSO READ: Most CBI officials were against Manish Sisodia’s arrest, claims KejriwalThe political aspirations of the AAP could get stymied by Sisodia's arrest not only because of a dent in its corruption-free image but also because Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal might have to allott the departments that were being taken care of by Sisodia if he has to stay behind bars for a long time.Manish Sisodia himself said that he could be away for seven to eight months while appearing for the CBI interrogation on Sunday. ""Even if I am in jail for 7-8 months, don't feel sorry for me, be proud,"" Sisodia had said.The AAP has projected Manish Sisodia as the ""best education minister in India"". So, ""Manish chacha's"" staying away for long won't be easy for the AAP to handle.     --- ENDS ---

But the visitors are leaving no stone unturned to stage a comeback in the four-match series, led by stand-in skipper Steve Smith.The third Test of the series begins in Indore on March 1, and with skipper Pat Cummins attending an illness in the family back home, the responsibility to lead the side has been given to Smith.Opener David Warner will miss the rest of the series after suffering a fractured elbow and concussion in Delhi and pace bowler Josh Hazlewood has flown home with a persistent Achilles.Read Also3rd Test: Orthodox cricket seems to be Australia's mantra for comebackIf Australian batters follow what they trained for on Monday ahead of the third Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy against India in Indore beginning March 1, it can be said that the Australians have done away with their tactics of sweeping everything bowled at them by the Indian spinners in thisIndia's 2-0 lead means they have already retained the Border-Gavaskar Trophy leaving Australia the task of winning both of the remaining Tests to level the four-match series.Fit-again duo of all-rounder Cameron Green and left-arm fast bowler Mitchell Starc are likely to be recalled, though spin is sure to play a big part in the match.""If myself or some of the other seamers get a chance out here we will have to play an important role with the spinners to take those 20 wickets,"" Starc said Monday.Smith was Australia captain between 2014 and 2018 before the ""sandpapergate"" scandal in South Africa ended his tenure.Read AlsoIndia vs Australia: Indore next pit stop in home dominanceThe surface is being preened and polished for the big occasion, the third Test between India and Australia starting from Wednesday. There is a veritable army of ground staff fussing and fretting over their latest creation. The pitch, after all, is a vital cog in India’s Test machinations at home.He captained the team that toured India in 2017 and led from the front with his batting as Australia went down to the hosts 2-1 in a hard-fought series.""It is pretty seamless,"" said Starc of Smith stepping in. ""He has obviously done it for a long time. I have played a lot of cricket with Steve as captain,"" said Starc. ""Hopefully it's another great week for our team to bounce back from the last two.""India, led by Rohit Sharma, will be looking to clinch the series and with it a berth in June's World Test Championship final at The Oval in London.India have depended on their spin trio of Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel to rip through the Australian batters, whose attempts to counter-attack failed in Delhi as they were bowled out for 113 after taking a slim first innings lead.Read AlsoIan Chappell slams Australia's sweep ploy, says Rohit Sharma showed the wayAustralia's predetermined sweep ploy in the first two Tests against India backfired heavily and that has led to Pat Cummins and co. conceding the Border-Gavaskar Trophy with the hosts taking an unassailable 2-0 lead after winning the Nagpur and Delhi Tests. Joining the list of critics, formerIndia's lower-order batting has played a big part in their success with Axar, who has come in at nine and eight in the order, scoring 158 runs -- the second-highest aggregate in the series behind Rohit's 183.Opener KL Rahul's extended batting slump has left him struggling to hold on to his spot with Shubman Gill expected to replace him at the top of the order.India did not name a vice-captain for the final two Tests, fuelling rumours that Rahul, who was Rohit's deputy in the first two matches, will be axed.""If the vice-captain doesn't perform, someone can take his place,"" former India coach Ravi Shastri told an ICC podcast, questioning the need for a deputy to be named for a home series.""I'm being blunt and brutal,"" he said. ""Overseas, it's different. Here, you want prime form, you want someone like Shubman Gill, who's red hot.""India opened the series with a resounding innings-and-132-run win in the first Test in Nagpur, followed by a six-wicket win in Delhi inside three days.

The second one is obviously less risky,'' said a central bank executive on the sidelines of the G20 meeting of finance ministers and central bankers.Getty ImagesThe RBI last July introduced Rupee payments for global trade, especially with Russia that was forced out of the global payments network following its invasion of Ukraine. More Asian countries, such as Indonesia and the United Arab Emirates, are showing interest in using the Rupee as a trading unit, potentially reducing dependence on the world's reserve currency for cross-border exchange of goods and services.""The world can trade two ways - in one currency and the second option is to trade in other currencies. The second one is obviously less risky,'' said a central bank executive on the sidelines of the G20 meeting of finance ministers and central bankers.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) last July introduced Rupee payments for global trade, especially with Russia that was forced out of the global payments network following its invasion of Ukraine. It permitted the opening of vostro accounts by Indian banks to facilitate settlement of transactions in Rupee.The move has made a circumspect start, but many banks have opened such accounts, prompting enquiries from other countries looking for an alternative to reduce risks. India's regulator backed National Payments Corp., which has evolved a strong payments railroad, is widening its presence and the government plans to exploit the advantage.India and Singapore launched the cross-border linkage that used respective payment systems - Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and PayNow - for transaction settlement.""The linkage of Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and PayNow is a new milestone in India-Singapore relations and its launch is a gift to the citizens of the two countries,"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi said at the launch earlier this week.India is also pushing a central bank-backed digital currency.""Our focus is to ensure that transactions are flawless,'' said the executive.Don’t miss out on ET Prime stories!

(Photo: AFP)In ShortRishabh Pant met with a horrific accident in December 2022Pant had to go through several surgeries and now is in the path of recoverySourav Ganguly has revealed that he spoke to Pant after his accidentBy India Today Sports Desk: It might take Rishabh Pant up to 2 years to play for India again, former India captain Sourav Ganguly has revealed. Ganguly who is with the Delhi Capitals in a management role for the upcoming Indian Premier League season, revealed the details in an interview with news agency PTI. Ganguly said that it would be tough to fill the void left by Rishabh Pant in the Delhi Capitals side, and the team has not finalised his replacement as of yet. The former batter said that he spoke to Pant a couple of times since his horrific accident in December 2022.advertisement""I spoke to him a couple of times. Obviously he is going through a tough period, through injuries and surgeries and I wish him well. In a year's time or may be in a couple of years' time, he will be back playing for India,"" Ganguly was quoted as saying by PTI.DC is yet to announce Pant's replacement and Ganguly is still undecided on who is better between young turk Abhishek Porel and domestic veteran Sheldon Jackson.""We still need a bit of time to figure out. The next camp starts before IPL,"" Ganguly said.DC are in the mission to find a captain and it is possible that Australian opener David Warner might be given the position due to his experience.DC held a three-day camp at Kolkata where the likes of Prithvi Shaw, Ishant Sharma, Chetan Sakariya, Manish Pandey were seen along with other domestic players.""The IPL is still a month away and the season has just started. It is difficult to get all the players together for the amount of cricket they play. There are four or five who are playing Irani Trophy. Sarfaraz has an injured finger and it's not a broken finger. He should be okay for the IPL,"" he concluded.--- ENDS ---Also Read |  2nd Test: Ben Duckett keeps England steady in 258-run chase on Day 4 after New Zealand fightback

The sector constitutes nearly 36 per cent of GSVA in 2022-23.Odisha's economy is estimated to grow by 7.8 per cent in real terms against the national rate of 7 per cent during the current financial year 2022-23, the state's economic survey report said. The state is also poised to register a growth in the range of 8 to 8.5 per cent in 2023-24 in real terms, the Odisha Economics Survey Report for the year 2022-23, tabled by Finance minister Niranjan Pujari in the Assembly said. Assuming a normal monsoon, no further disruption to global supply chains and moderation in inflation, Odisha can grow in the range of 8 to 8.5 per cent in 2023-24 in real terms, the report said, adding that the state is expected to grow at a rate higher than All-India average growth. The industry and service sectors have been the major engines of economic growth in the state, the report said. ""During the pre-COVID period (2012-13 to 2019-20), the average growth rate of Odisha's economy was 7.1 per cent. The decade of 2021-30 is expected to work in favour of India given its demographics structure, usage of technology, push for innovation, competitive and cooperative federalism, stable government. Odisha has all the resources to benefit from a high growth environment in the country and deliver prosperity for all,"" the report said. In 2021-22, the state's GSDP grew by 11.5 per cent. Odisha's growth resilience is reflected in its average medium-term growth rate of 7.9 per cent from 2013-14 to 2021-22, leaving aside the pandemic years. The report mentioned that the state's economy recovered from COVID-19 induced economic shocks in 2022-23. But, due to Russia-Ukraine war led disruption in global supply chains and upward movement in energy and other commodity prices, the inflation 2022-23 has gone up. In Odisha, the average inflation till December 2022 was 6.56 per cent higher than 3.7 per cent in 2021-22. Agriculture and allied sectors constitute nearly 22.5 per cent of Gross Value Added (GSVA) (2022-23 AE). The sector employs more than 40 per cent of the workforce, thus being the biggest employment generating sector in Odisha. This sector is expected to grow at 5.9 per cent in 2022-23 as against 3.5 per cent at all-India level. Similarly, the industry sector, which has been the key growth driver in the state, has recorded the highest growth on average in the pre-COVID-19 times (7 per cent). In 2022-23, the industry sector is expected to grow at 6.1 per cent, as per the report. The mining sector constitutes more than 10 per cent of GSVA. Therefore, any movement in mining activity impacts not just the mining sector but also the manufacturing sector and other sectors through backward and forward linkages, it said. The third major sector, the Services sector, is expected to grow at 8.8 per cent in 2022-23, higher than pre-COVID average growth. The sector constitutes nearly 36 per cent of GSVA in 2022-23. Another major aspect of the report is the per capita income of Odisha which has multiplied thrice between 2011-12 and 2022-23 while at all India level, it is multiplied by 2.7 times. Odisha's per capita income grew at an annual compound rate of 10.9 per cent against 9.4 per cent CAGR of India's PCI. ""The state's rate of growth in PCI is much faster than the national rate of increase thus successfully reducing the gap,"" the report said, adding that Odisha's PCI at present (2022-23) is Rs 150,676 in current price as against All India average PCI of Rs 170,620 (current price). The state has been under revenue surplus continuously for the last 17 years since the enactment of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act (FRBM), the report said, adding that the total outstanding liabilities as percentage of GSDP stood at 15.6 per cent in 2022-23. Odisha is among six highest spending states in the country. In 2020-21, the total public expenditure (revenue expenditure plus capital outlay) of the state was 21.3 per cent of GDP. The state has also invested heavily in building capacity for growth. The state is one among the two highest spenders on capacity creation as proxied by capital outlay as a percentage of GSDP. In 2020-21, the state spent 3.4 per cent of GSDP under capital outlay. Having more than 35 per cent of the country's natural resources and huge reserves of iron ore, bauxite, coal, and other natural resources, with a skilled workforce, the state would continue to grow at a faster rate, the report said.Don’t miss out on ET Prime stories!

The murder resembles a scene from the film Gangs of Wasseypur.AdvertisementIndia Today News DeskNew Delhi,UPDATED: Feb 27, 2023 16:37 ISTUmesh Pal's murder scene resembled a scene from Gangs of Wasseypur By India Today News Desk: Umesh Pal, the prime witness in the 2005 BSP MLA Raju Pal murder case, was shot dead on February 24 outside his house in Uttar Pradesh’s Prayagraj. The assailant used three vehicles and crude bombs to envelop the area in smoke before firing 14 rounds of bullets. Arbaz, one of the accused in Umesh Pal's murder, was killed in an encounter by Uttar Pradesh Police on Monday. advertisementThe scene of Umesh Pal’s murder resembles a scene from the film Gangs of Wasseypur. In the film too, the character of Sardar Khan is surrounded by criminals and killed by spraying bullets at his vehicle. Just like in the film, Umesh Pal’s killers hurled crude bombs at him. Umesh was on his way back home from a court hearing and the assailants started following his vehicle from the court. Another group of armed assailants was waiting near Umesh Pal’s house pretending to be customers at an electronics shop. One of them had crude bombs in his bag and was waiting for Umesh Pal to arrive at the spot.

The shooters fired seven bullets at Umesh Pal, of which six hit him. After using a crude bomb to envelop the area in smoke, the assailants fled from the scene of the crime.

The current condition of wheat crop is very good. Our procurement should be normal at 300-400 lakh tonne in 2023-24,"" Meena said in a press conference. The wheat procurement had declined last year due to a fall in domestic production and higher exports, he said.Last year, wheat procurement for the central pool had declined to 187.92 lakh tonne from 433.44 lakh tonne in the 2021-22 marketing year, as per the official data.The government expects to procure around 30-40 million tonnes of wheat during the marketing year 2023-2024, said Food Corporation of India (FCI) chairman and managing director Ashok K Meena adding that the wheat crop is in good condition as of now.“Area sown to wheat is higher than last year. The current condition of wheat crop is very good. Our procurement should be normal at 300-400 lakh tonne in 2023-24,” Meena said durin a press briefing.Last year, wheat procurement for the central pool had declined to 18.79 MT from 43.3 MT in the 2021-22 marketing year due to early onset of heat which led to a drop in production and increased private purchase of the commodity.This led to an abnormal increase in the price of the food grain, compelling the government to sell wheat under the open market sales scheme (OMSS). The FCI, which is the nodal agency of the government for procurement and distribution of food grains for welfare schemes, has already undertaken three e-auctions to sell wheat to bulk buyers.Don’t miss out on ET Prime stories!

Mann`s remarks came after thousands of followers of the alleged pro-Khalistan outfit stormed the Ajnala police station, flashing swords and high-caliber firearms, on February 23, threatening the police with dire consequences if they did not release Lovepreet Toofan, who was arrested for allegedly assaulting and abducting a man.

On alleged pro-Khalistan slogans being raised and the deteriorating law and order situation in his state, Mann said, ""Do you consider 1,000 people as representing entire Punjab? Come to Punjab and see who are raising such slogans. It`s just a few people funded by foreign powers, especially Pakistan. Rajasthan shares a bigger boundary with Pakistan than Punjab.

Why aren`t drones (from Pakistan) sent there? Why are they all coming to Punjab? Their handlers want to disturb peace in Punjab.""He stressed peace prevails in Punjab and his government was driving the state towards development.""Punjab will not be disturbed. There is peace in the state. The Punjab government is taking the state towards progress,"" the CM said.

However, former Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh, on February 23, expressed grave concern over the Ajnala incident.""This is not just a complete collapse of the law and order situation in Punjab, but more serious than that,"" Capt Amarinder said earlier, pointing out that the incident has serious security implications for the state and the country.
A day after the clashes, Mann, on February 24, claimed that the law and order situation was under control.Punjab`s Director General of Police, Gaurav Yadav, said earlier appropriate action will be taken against the people involved in the violence.""As far as yesterday`s incident is concerned, appropriate action will be taken. The video footage is being analysed.

The SP was injured and was administered 11 stitches. Five other Police personnel were also injured. Their statement will be recorded and further legal action will be taken,"" the DGP said on February 24.Terming the attack on policemen as cowardly, the DGP added, ""Police worked with utmost restraint considering the sanctity of the Guru Granth Sahib. An attack on the police in the cover of the Guru Granth Sahib was an act of cowardice."" Live TvBhagwant Mannlovepreet toofanAmritpal Singhkhalistanpro khalistan slogansMore Stories Live updates LIVE Updates | Court Sends Sisodia To CBI Remand Till March 4 BA Student UP Exam Shocker!

Tharoor argued that the Congress invariably plays into the BJP’s hands due to its tendency to downplay some positions or avoid taking a stand on issues in order to not hurt the assumed sentiments of the majority.  The former Union minister minced no words when he said: “We must have the courage of our convictions. We could have been more vocal on the Bilkis Bano outrage, the attacks on Christian churches, murder in the name of cow vigilantism, bulldozer demolition of Muslim homes and similar issues.” advertisementLast August, all 11 convicts sentenced to life imprisonment in the 2002 post-Godhra riots Bilkis Bano gang-rape case walked out of jail after the Gujarat government allowed their release under its remission policy, triggering outrage across the country.  These harsh words by Tharoor expectedly made news but what went unnoticed was his opinion on the party’s economic vision. Of course, he toed the Congress line when, speaking on the economic resolution passed on the second day of the three-day plenary, Tharoor said that the Congress should outline the elements of a progressive economic agenda that addresses head on the challenge of unacceptable economic inequality. Like his colleagues, Tharoor also raised the need to launch a direct assault on “rampant crony capitalism”, which he said is “concentrating wealth in the hands of a few friends of the ruling regime and is damaging the economy, leading to massive problems of rising unemployment and diminished futures for young Indians”.  But what was missed out was his focus on not projecting the party as anti-business. He lamented the fact that the Congress, which liberalised the economy in 1991, is now seen as a party against the business class. “We should reassure those who fear we are anti-businessâ€¦ that we stand by the liberalisation measures that were the gift of a Congress government to the nation, but along with a strong commitment to social justice,” he said at the plenary. Ironically, the Congress is launching a massive agitation programme from March 6 against industrialist Gautam Adani over an alleged scam reported by a foreign short-seller company. The Congress economic resolution at the plenary talks of a “new economic performance metric that correlates directly to the median Indian’s living standards, economic mobility, and hopes for a better future”. But the reassurance that Tharoor mentioned was not there. Instead the economic resolution says that the new economic vision and action will be re-crafted from the current obsession with capital and move more towards labour.  Of course, the objective of creating more jobs, increasing incomes and providing healthy living standards and livelihoods is much needed, but making ‘capital’ the bad word may not go down well with the business class. In contrast, Tharoor said: “India will not shine until it shines for all and business people have a crucial role to play as wealth generators and job creators.” advertisementWhile the Congress resolutions have taken note of the need to reach out to the urban population by proposing an ‘urban MGNREGA’ and better housing, Tharoor made a direct appeal, unlike any other speaker at the plenary. He raised the concerns of urban dwellers, who demand public utilities such as city transport, good roads, affordable housing, clean drinking water and decent education in government schools. “All of this requires our voice as well,” he said. It’s now for the Congress to see if it will pay attention to Tharoor’s pointers. The first indication of that will come from the formation of the Congress Working Committee (CWC). Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, who had defeated Tharoor in the presidential poll last year, has been authorised by the party to nominate all members of the CWC. It is yet to be seen if Kharge would want to take inputs from the vision of his challenger, paving the way for an inclusive Congress think-tank.Subscribe to India Today Magazine--- ENDS ---

Her complaint alleges that her senior and direct managers, both male, consistently excluded her from meetings while inviting her male counterparts, criticised her, micromanaged her work and deprived her of bonuses, despite positive performance evaluations and significant team contributions.BloombergApple Inc. lost an early round in a discrimination lawsuit brought in the U.S. by a female engineer from India who says her two managers -- one from her country, the other from Pakistan -- treated her as they would in their own countries: as a subservient.The woman’s case in California state court is the latest to allege workplace bias in Silicon Valley that focuses on cultural prejudices of some tech workers from South Asia. Cisco Systems Inc. is fighting a suit brought by California’s civil rights agency alleging bias against a member of India’s so-called lower castes, known as Dalits.Anita Nariani Schulze is part of the Sindhi minority -- she is Hindu, with ancestry in the Sindh region of what is now Pakistan. Her complaint alleges that her senior and direct managers, both male, consistently excluded her from meetings while inviting her male counterparts, criticized her, micromanaged her work, and deprived her of bonuses, despite positive performance evaluations and significant team contributions.Schulze claims the managers’ animus reflects sexism, racism, religious bias and discrimination on the basis of national origin. The Sindhi Hindu nationality is “known for its technical acumen” and its gender equality, she says, which “exacerbated the managers’ discriminatory treatment.”In a tentative ruling on Wednesday, Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Sunil R. Kulkarni rejected Apple’s request to toss out the suit. While not ruling on the merits of the case, Kulkarni said Schulze had adequately supported her legal claims. Apple had argued her claims weren’t specific enough and were based on stereotypes.But the judge rejected Schulze’s request to represent a class of female Apple employees who suffered job discrimination over the last four years. He agreed with Apple that she didn’t show a pattern of discrimination that could be applied to a broader group.Discover the stories of your interestBlockchain5 StoriesCyber-safety7 StoriesFintech9 StoriesE-comm9 StoriesML8 StoriesEdtech6 StoriesIt wasn’t clear from the court’s docket whether the judge will hold a hearing Thursday before issuing a final ruling.Apple didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.In the Cisco case, the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing alleged that two Indian employees at the San Jose-based company discriminated against a Dalit co-worker on the basis of caste.Cisco has denied the claims, insisting it has “zero tolerance for discrimination.” It also said the lawsuit should be tossed out because caste isn’t a protected category under U.S. civil rights law.Don’t miss out on ET Prime stories!

After the omission got trolled on social media, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh apologized through a tweet, calling it ""an inexcusable slipup."" ""Responsibility for it is being fixed and action will be taken,"" said Ramesh. The ad carried images of 10 stalwarts, including past presidents of Congress as well as PMs who are no more. The notable exclusion is Maulana Azad, who spent over 10 years in British jails and was two-time INC president.‘Some call it Congress plan to distance from minorities’A Congress advertisement put out on Sunday carried sepia-toned images of 10 stalwarts—Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Sardar Patel, B R Ambedkar, Subhash Chandra Bose, Sarojini Naidu, Lal Bahadur Shastri, Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi and P V Narasimha Rao. The notable exclusion is Maulana Azad who spent over 10 years in British jails, was two-time president of INC, opposed the two-nation theory tooth and nail and became India’s first education minister after independence. “This is an unpardonable mistake on the part of those who approved the ad for an important occasion in the 137-year history of the Congress. I hope this is not true, but people are seeing it as part of the party’s strategy to stay away from Muslims, including Muslim freedom fighters,” said Mumbai Congress general secretary Asif Farooqui. Rightwing commentators and BJP leaders have often criticized the Congress for ignoring the legacies of Bose, Patel and Ambedkar. Naidu and Shastri seldom figure in ads released by Congress while Rao, many complain, is never given his due in the grand old party where Gandhi-Nehru have dominated for decades. The ad serves to present a pantheon of the party’s most illustrious leaders from the past. “After I received many messages flagging the mistake, I shared them with some senior leaders, including Jairam Ramesh. He apologized on behalf of the party. I am glad he has said action will be taken and hopefully this slipup is not repeated in future,” said Congress MLA Amin Patel who too attended the session in Raipur. Some saw it as a deliberate attempt to follow the Hindutva script. Drawing parallels with the omission of Azad’s and Nehru’s images from the Azadi Ka Amrut Mahotsav poster prepared by Indian Council of Historical Research (ICHR), activist and president of the Aligarh Muslim University Alumni in Maharashtra Tanweer Alam said: “The Congress follows the BJP when it comes to invisibilizing Muslim freedom fighters.”1/20Congress' 85th Plenary Session Previous NextShow Captions<p>Congress promised to bring a law against hate crimes, guarantee citizens right to free healthcare, restore statehood of Jammu and Kashmir, create a National Election Fund and extend special category status to AP in the draft political resolution moved at the party's plenary.</p><p>The resolution said that the assembly elections this year in nine states and 2024 Lok Sabha polls were ""crucial for India's future"" and there is an urgent need for united opposition to take on the BJP-led NDA government on ideological grounds.<br /></p><p>It said the party will restore special category status to the North Eastern States, Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand.<br /></p><p>The draft resolution came down heavily on the BJP-led government, accusing it of political vendetta and abusing central agencies like ED, NIA, CBI and IT 'to intimidate and subjugate political opponents.'<br /></p><p>""From 2004 to 2014, the Congress-led alliance with like-minded parties served the people of the country. We once again look forward to forging a viable alternative by aligning with like-minded parties to defeat the anti-people and undemocratic BJP government.""<br /></p><p>Congress leader Sonia Gandhi said she was happy that her innings could conclude with the Bharat Jodo Yatra, with the party asserting that the remark was about her tenure as the party president and had nothing to do with her retirement from politics.<br /></p><p>After a video was played on her contributions to the party, former Congress president said, ""This also shows how old I have become and now, young people under the leadership of Mallikarjun Kharge must take forward.""</p><p>""When we asked in Parliament what is the PM's relation with Adani our entire speech was expunged. We will ask in Parliament thousands of times till the truth of Adani ji is out, we will not stop,"" he said amid applause.</p><p>He said the party should formulate a new plan to carry forward the ""tapasya "" undertaken through the Bharat Jodo Yatra and that he along with the entire country will participate in it, indicating another such initiative.​<br /></p><p>""Now only one year is left for us, there are expectations from us, that we will unite (opposition). All the opposition parties and people whose ideology is opposed to them (BJP), must fight unitedly. There are expectations from everyone but the most expectations are from the Congress.""<br /></p><p>She also exhorted Congress workers to take the message of the party and the failures of the government to the people.</p><p>Congress workers laid flower petals on the street to welcome party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi and other leaders in Raipur on Saturday for the 85th plenary session.<br /><br /></p><p>Marking a landmark organisational change, Congress decided to provide a 50 % reservation to SCs, STs, OBCs, women, youth and minorities in its working committee and at all party positions.<br /></p><p>""Unfortunately, the law minister himself is leading the blatant attack on the judiciary. Congress promises that the independence and integrity of the judiciary will be maintained and protected at all costs,"" the party said in its resolution.</p><p>""Himachal Pradesh is a small state but the victory there was big. Hindus account for 97% of population. BJP's national president JP Nadda also hails from there. Congress' ideology of humanity defeated BJP's Hindu ideology.”<br /></p><p>Pawan Khera was on his way to Raipur for the Congress plenary session when he was arrested by the police who deplaned him and took him away.<br /></p><p>During a press conference, Khera had referred to the PM as “Narendra Gautamdas Modi” criticising the BJP government over the Adani-Hindenburg crisis. That led to FIRs against him in Assam and Uttar Pradesh.<br /></p><p>Hailing the apex court's grant of interim bail to Khera, Ramesh invoked the title of a Salman Khan film to say that the ""Supreme Court Zinda Hai.""<br /></p>Watch Muslim leaders seethe as Congress leaves out Maulana Azad from advertisement, call it deliberate insultStart a ConversationFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIAFacebookTwitterInstagramKOO APPYOUTUBE Visual Stories  Sunny Leone stuns in lehengasEntertainmentFarzi actor Shahid Kapoor’s secret to ripped physiqueLifestyleHere's what Ambanis wore for bash at Isha Ambani's homeLifestyle11 times Alia Bhatt proved she is a poster girl for mini dressesEntertainmentScenic hill stations in Uttarakhand for your March traveltravelShraddha Arya's versatile western outfitstvAnanya Panday’s food photos from Doha have left us cravingFoodRRR's list of award wins ahead of Oscars 2023EntertainmentIn pics: Samantha completes 13 years in TollywoodEntertainment123ElectionsErode Election LiveNagaland Election 2023 LiveBypolls 2023 LiveMeghalaya Election 2023 LiveNagaland Exit PollsTripura Election ResultMeghalaya Exit PollsNagaland Election ResultsTop TrendingErode Bypoll LiveTejas ExpressIndia vs AustraliaBypolls 2023 LiveAiden MarkramNagaland Election 2023Trending StoriesIn CityEntire WebsiteSextortion case: 2 held for blackmailing Juhu bizmanWe do not eye elections while working for Mumbai: CM'Buffalo hump' on the neck giving away HIV+ statusDrunk cop slaps man in Navi Mumbai barCong omits Azad from ad, slammed by Muslim netasISB's Chief Digital Officer ProgrammeLatest news updates from MaharashtraAjit Pawar demands caste-based census in MahaMaha 'warning': Brace for stormy budget sessionBypolls: 41.1% voter turnout in Chinchwad, 45.25% in KasbaDelhi excise policy: What CBI asked Manish Sisodia during 8-hour questioningLive: Sisodia likely to be produced before court at 2pmHow you could have made money out of Adani stocksLive: K'taka has scaled new heights of development, says PMEnjoy the luxury of recliner seats on Tejas ExpressMaulana Azad missing from Congress ad; deliberate, say Muslim netasIs Amritpal Singh Punjab's Bhindranwale 2.0?Isle of Man cricket team dismissed for 10 runsWant players to express themselves: SRH captain MarkramAgnipath scheme in 'national interest': Delhi HCAbout usCreate Your Own AdTerms of Use and Grievance Redressal Policy Privacy policyAdvertise with usRSSNewsletterFeedbackePaperSitemapArchivesFOLLOW US ONOther Times Group News SitesThe Economic TimesHindi Economic TimesNavbharat TimesMaharashtra TimesVijaya KarnatakaTelugu SamayamTamil SamayamMalayalam SamayamEi SamayI am GujaratTimesPointsIndiatimesBrand CapitalEducation TimesTimes FoodMiss KyraMumbai MirrorBangalore MirrorPopular CategoriesHeadlinesSports NewsBusiness NewsIndia NewsWorld NewsBollywood NewsHealth & Fitness TipsIndian TV ShowsCelebrity PhotosHot on the WebK Vishwanaths Death NewsHrithik RoshanHoney GingerBollywood CouplesBaby NamesRakhi SawantSachin Shroff WeddingVastu TipsRakesh SujathasShehnaaz GillTop TrendsErode Bypoll LiveTejas ExpressIndia vs AustraliaBypolls 2023 LiveAiden MarkramNagaland Election 2023Meghalaya Election 2023Manish Sisodia ArrestShivamogga AirportArvind KejriwalNEET PG 2023CBSE Board Exam 2023Bank Holidays in MarchMeghalaya Election Exit PollsNagaland Election Exit PollsTripura Election ResultCryptocurrency Price in IndiaIPL Schedule 2023Trending TopicsParineeti ChopraParenting TipsRelationships TipsShark Tank India 2Rich Dosa RecipesGondola Rides In VeniceOld FridgeMushroom BenefitsSAG Awards 2023Heart DiseasesBest Food For HealthGenelia D'SouzaBollywood Actor TransformationsShanthi PriyaKottayam Nazeer Health NewsBollywood CelebritiesVivo Y55sLaptops under 30000WiFi RoutersTablets under 15000Living and entertainmentiDivaMensXP.comFeminaETimesGraziaZoomTravel DestinationsBombay TimesCricbuzz.comFilmfareOnline SongsTVLifestyleLongwalks AppNewspaper SubscriptionFood NewsTimes PrimeWhats HotServicesCouponDuniaMagicbricksTechGigTimesJobsBollywood NewsTimes MobileGadgets NowCareersColombiaCopyright © 2023 Bennett, Coleman & Co.

Here’s whyBajaj Auto shares fall over 5% after demonetisation in Nigeria. Here’s why Bajaj Auto shares fell sharply on Monday after a note ban came into effect in Africa's most populous country, Nigeria. Here is all you need to know. AdvertisementIndia Today Business DeskNew Delhi ,UPDATED: Feb 27, 2023 14:36 ISTBajaj Auto shares fell over 5 per cent during intraday trade on Monday. (Photo: Reuters) By India Today Business Desk: Shares of Indian two-wheeler manufacturer Bajaj Auto tanked over 5 per cent on Monday after a note ban came into effect in Nigeria. Bajaj Auto shares were down 5.14 per cent at around 2:22 pm. A note ban was announced by Nigeria's federal government and central bank in October 2022. It came into effect from February 10, crippling the country's economy. advertisementThe development will hurt Bajaj Auto as Nigeria is its biggest market in terms of exports. The country accounts for almost a fourth of Bajaj Auto’s exports. Bajaj Auto is expected to cut down on production of motorcycles and three-wheelers across its export-focused plants from next month, reported The Economic Times. It is almost certain that there will be a sharp decline in demand due to demonetisation, and it has already forced Bajaj Auto to cut production at plants in Waluj and Pant Nagar, the business daily's report added. Read | Bajaj Auto Q3 FY23 results: Profit jumps 23%, Ebitda at record level againImpact of Nigeria note ban on Bajaj AutoMultiple people aware of the development have also confirmed to the publication that Bajaj Auto will produce around 2,50,000-2,70,000 units in March, compared to 3,38,000 units in each of the first nine months of FY23. As a result, the capacity utilisation at these plants, pegged at 5,50,000 units every month, could fall nearly 50 per cent. Rakesh Sharma, executive director, Bajaj Auto, confirmed to ET that the company has cut shipments “substantively’ till things settle. Sharma agreed that there is a lot of uncertainty in Nigeria, both civil and economic, due to elections and demonetisation. Also Read | Sensex, Nifty open lower tracking weak global cues; IT, media stocks dragThe demonetisation in the African nation is likely to negatively impact Bajaj Auto’s exports, which have already seen an average decline of over 34 per cent year-on-year for the past six months. The company’s exports in January 2023 stood at a 30-month low of 1,00,679 and could further take a hit with the note ban in Nigeria. Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country, took the decision to demonetise  200, 500 and 1,000 naira notes last year and start circulating new ones. The government set a deadline of January 31, 2023 for people to get rid of their old currency notes, but gave an extension till February 10, as per local media reports. The motive behind the move is to reduce the amount of cash in circulation, aimed at curbing inflation, controlling liquidity and promoting a cashless economy.Watch | Demonetisation is crippling Nigeria's economy--- ENDS ---

Diplomats say countries in the Indo-Pacific want the EU to be more active in the region to keep trade free and open, and to ensure they are not left facing a straight choice between Beijing and Washington.France committed to closer ties with allies such as Australia and India with an Indo-Pacific strategy in 2018, followed by the Netherlands, which also has its own strategy, and Germany's looser set of ""guidelines"".The EU strategy, if agreed, could involve putting more EU military experts in EU diplomatic missions in Asia, training coast guards and sending more EU military personnel to serve on Australian ships patrolling in the Indian Ocean, diplomats said.It is unclear how much Germany, which has close business ties to China, will commit to any new strategy. German government officials say the EU cannot afford to alienate Beijing despite labelling China a ""systemic rival"" in 2019.But French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian will travel to India in April to develop the EU's Indo-Pacific strategy, and the EU aims to hold a summit with India this year.France, which has 1.8 million citizens in Pacific overseas territories, has about 4,000 troops in the region, plus navy ships and patrol boats.""The Indo-Pacific is the cornerstone of Europe's geopolitical path,"" said a French diplomat.

India NewsReported by Ashish Kumar Bhargava, Edited by Shatabdi ChowdhuryUpdated: February 27, 2023 5:52 pm ISTThe Supreme Court has now posted the matter after Holi vacation.New Delhi: The Supreme Court today pulled up the Ministry of Defence over its communication regarding the payment of arrears under One Rank One Pension (OROP) in four instalments to eligible pensioners of the armed forces. A bench led by Chief Justice DY Chandrachud asked the ministry to get its ""house in order"" and warned that it would issue a contempt notice if the notification wasn't withdrawn.""The orders of the Supreme Court regarding OROP needs to be followed. Why was the decision taken to pay the arrears in instalments despite the court order?"" asked the Supreme Court.The court was hearing a petition by a group of ex-servicemen who were seeking a direction to the Centre that the arrears should be paid in one instalment instead of four. The group of ex-servicemen said that approximately four lakh pensioners have died during the pendency of the petition.On January 9, 2023, the Supreme Court had asked the Center to pay the arrears to the armed force pensioners by March 15. However, just days later, on January 20, the Defense Secretary issued a notification saying that the department would pay the arrears in four instalments.The bench has now directed the secretary to file a personal affidavit explaining his position.The Chief Justice, during the hearing, categorically said that ""court proceedings must be fair"". ""It is not a war but a rule of law.

Here is all you need to know. AdvertisementIndia Today Business DeskNew Delhi ,UPDATED: Feb 27, 2023 13:54 ISTAir India CEO shared key details about the airline's future strategy. (Photo: Reuters) By India Today Business Desk: A few weeks after Air India announced the biggest deal in the history of commercial aviation, the carrier’s CEO, Campbell Wilson, shared details about his experience at the airline, the significance of the 470-jet deal, future market strategy and its role in developing the country into a world class aviation hub. In an interview with Business Today, Wilson said he has been “pleasantly surprised at how aligned people have become behind what we are trying to do”. advertisement“There are a lot of good people from Air India. Their enthusiasm to elevate this airline to world-class standards excites the rest of us,” he told Business Today. “I am really happy to see this cultural meld taking place. I would just like to say that the folks that had been carrying Air India through, have done a fantastic job despite facing very many challenges over the years,” Wilson added.Also Read | Air India seals world’s biggest ever aviation deal: Here’s all you need to knowDomestic and international strategy Commenting on future strategy for Air India, he said, “We will eventually end up with one full-service (Air India) and one low-cost (Air India Express) airline group. But the two should work in synergy.Elaborating on this plan, he said much of the domestic market will be served by the low-cost airline, but it is also going to enjoy and support the international network feed coming in from overseas on the full-service brand, travelling domestically on the low-cost brand and vice versa. “Ultimately, we want the group to operate as one network and one distribution and one sales platform so that we can provide the risk, the best cost structure and the best product for the relevant market by taking advantage of the economies of scale, and the breadth and the reach of the group as a whole,” he said. Also Read | Air India | A fleet fit for the MaharajaHiring plans Campbell Wilson shared details about Air India’s hiring plans as well. He said the airline is hiring about 100 pilots and 500 cabin crew a month, in addition to ground staff. He added that more than 1,500 people have joined the organisation, including in non-flying positions. “We’ve taken a little bit of a pause for the moment because whilst we go through this process of merging AirAsia and Air India Express and planning for the merger of Vistara into Air India, we want to ensure that everyone in the group has a position and future,” he said. “We want to get external people in where we need them but also need to accommodate existing people within the group.”Better interior, in-flight entertainment in all classesAir India’s record plane deal is likely to have a major impact on transforming India into a global aviation hub. During the interview, the Air India CEO provided several key details about the deal and what it means for the country’s aviation sector. advertisementWilson said, “We will have negotiated long and hard and so what we pay is much less than the headline figure. This new order is for our future.”“There are three parts of our fleet and network development – and with that comes product development too – because new aircraft come with new products. The first is the short term, which is essentially this year and the first half of next year, which is largely about bringing in leased aircraft,” he added.Wilson said the carrier has 36 aircraft on lease and 16 of them are going to be widebody – this will give the airline a significant capacity boost. He said, “It is a natural uplift from where we are today.”In the medium-term, around mid-2024-25, the airline will be spending $400 million on completely refitting the entire interior of its widebody fleet with new seats and in-flight entertainment in all classes. From mid-2025 onwards, Air India will also start receiving new orders and those will be completely new products. Better frequent flier programme and rationalising fares advertisementThe Air India CEO said the airline would be looking to further expand its frequent flier programme.“In the same way, in which Air India’s technology platform had not been invested over the course of years, the loyalty progamme also needs a lot of work. We are currently in the process of designing what the future stake looks like and how it can be best supported,” he said. Wilson said over the course of this year, the airline will start rolling out more changes towards a significant upgrade of the frequent flier proposition, and also capabilities of the people to interact with it. “As regards the network, given the investments we are making in the product and services and the aspirations we have for Air India and, of course, the fundamentals of the Indian aviation sector that I spoke about, we are receiving a lot of interest from carriers around the world to partner with us. But we are taking our time to develop our strategy, but international relationships are important to Air India as they are to every other airline,” he added. advertisementWilson said that Air India is already a “price-competitive” airline, adding that the market will determine what people will pay for their product. “That is a product of competition, but it is also a function of the product, services and what people expect. And as we improve our seats, improve our reliability and make sure our services are world-class, people would be comfortable paying for what we offer,” he said during the interview.“Of course, as we improve our scale, as we improve our efficiency, there are cost savings that we might be able to enjoy that we can then pass on to customers. That can potentially be a win-win for both,” he added. Also Read | Air India handed over to Tata Group--- ENDS ---

He will be leading the Orange Army in the 2023 Indian Premier League season, starting March 31.New Zealand's Kane Williamson had led the Sunrisers last season. The team finished a disappointing eighth, with six wins and eight defeats.Williamson was released by Sunrisers ahead of this year's auction, where Gujarat Titans secured his services.

Sunrisers will play their opening match against the Rajasthan Royals in Hyderabad on April 2.The star all-rounder in fact was also the winner of the Player of the Tournament award at the SA20 for a stupendous all-round show - 366 runs and 11 wickets.On being appointed as Sunrisers captain, Markram told TimesofIndia.com - ""I always look for characters who can handle high pressure in a tournament like the IPL.

The central probe agency on Sunday arrested Sisodia in connection with alleged corruption in the now-scrapped excise policy relating to the sale of alcohol.

Sisodia was arrested after nearly eight hours of questioning on various aspects of the excise policy for 2021-22, which the probe agency says suffered from irregularities both in its formulation and implementation, allegedly intended to benefit people with links to the AAP.

""Now everyone knows that whatever you write and say is fabricated,"" he said in a tweet in Hindi. 

""Let the law work,"" he added.

Manish Sisodia gave 'evasive replies', did not cooperate in investigation: CBI
A CBI official said that they were not satisfied with Manish Sisodia's answers and that he was not cooperating in the investigation and avoided clarifications sought on crucial points.

""He gave evasive replies and did not cooperate in the investigation despite being confronted with evidence to the contrary. Therefore, he has been arrested,"" the CBI said in a statement.

The CBI said the Delhi Deputy CM was issued a notice under CrPC section 41A to attend the investigation on February 19.

""However, he sought time of one week citing his preoccupation. Accepting his request, he was issued a notice for attending the investigation on February 26 for answering various questions evaded by him during his examination on October 17, 2022, and further questions relating to his incriminating role based on evidence collected during the investigation of the case,"" the agency added.
Sisodia's arrest, one of the highest-profile actions against an opposition leader, comes after that of Satyendar Jain, Delhi's then health minister, in June last year. 

Both ministers have led what the AAP describes as the successful transformation of Delhi's education and health services, contributing to the party's popularity and continued electoral success.Live TvArvind KejriwalCBIManish SisodiaDelhi Excise Policy caseAAPMore Stories Live updates LIVE Updates | Court Sends Sisodia To CBI Remand Till March 4 BA Student UP Exam Shocker!

This will be the real setback for a party born out of an anti-corruption movement. And a crisis is also brewing in Punjab.
AdvertisementDarpan SinghNew Delhi,UPDATED: Feb 27, 2023 16:12 ISTCourts will decide whether or not Manish Sisodia (right) or Satyendar Jain (left) are corrupt but public perception matters in politics.By Darpan Singh: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has arrested AAP leader Manish Sisodia in connection with alleged corruption in the formulation and implementation of the now-scrapped liquor policy for 2021-22 in the national capital.In May last year, another AAP leader, Satyendar Jain, had been arrested by the Enforcement Directorate, another agency under the BJP-led central government, for his alleged involvement in a money laundering case.advertisementThese are no ordinary politicians. Sisodia is Delhi’s Deputy Chief Minister and holds several high-stakes portfolios, including education whose “successes” the AAP has tried to show-case to the world. 
ALSO READDelhi liquor scam: Manish Sisodia arrested by CBI after 8-hour questioningLikewise, Jain is Delhi’s prison minister. The irony couldn’t be starker as the Tihar jail complex, from where visuals of his getting massages and sumptuous meals have been leaked, comes under his department. Jain is also Delhi’s health minister, a position that’s been under much spotlight following the Covid-19 pandemic.And the AAP is no ordinary party either. It was born out of an anti-corruption movement, called the Anna Andolan, in Delhi about a decade ago. Though still with zero Lok Sabha MPs, it’s the only Opposition party that’s been growing in states: it has chief ministers in Delhi and Punjab and a few MLAs in Goa and also in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s home state and BJP bastion Gujarat.With the Congress’s decline, the AAP is a party that routed the BJP in two back-to-back elections in Delhi from where the saffron brigade rules the country. Now, Arvind Kejriwal’s party has also ended 15 years of the BJP’s rule in Delhi’s municipal corporation.  ALSO READMedical test, courtroom hearing. What's next for Manish SisodiaA furious AAP has called Sisodia’s arrest a political vendetta and its protests against the BJP and the Modi government across states will only intensify. 
Delhi’s ruling party would know that arrests aren’t its real challenge. In the past, several AAP MLAs have been arrested by the Delhi Police, which reports to the Centre, and let off by courts. However, this time, the situation seems far more serious. For AAP detractors, the charge of corruption seems to be sticking. The argument is: why has Jain not been granted bail in about a year?Sisodia, who heads 18 of the 33 Delhi government departments, is also facing a CBI-investigated case of ""political snooping"" for which the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) has given its clearance for his prosecution.ALSO READMost CBI officials were against Manish Sisodia’s arrest, claims KejriwaladvertisementThe BJP has unleashed a battery of spokespersons to brand the AAP as a corrupt party, trying to deal a blow to Arvind Kejriwal’s aspirations of being PM Modi’s challenger in 2024 when India votes to elect its new government. Courts will decide whether or not Sisodia or Jain are corrupt but public perception matters in politics.However, the AAP’s biggest challenge could be the possibility of its key leaders being sentenced by courts, especially if the jail term is of two years or more.  As per the Representation of the People Act of 1951, MPs, MLAs and MLCs lose their seats if they are sentenced to two years in jail or more. After such a conviction, they are not voters for six years and, thus, cannot contest elections during that period.ALSO READDelhi liquor scam: How Arvind Kejriwal govt has plunged into crisis after Manish Sisodia's arrestAZAM KHAN CASEA bit of context: Cases of disqualification have come from the neighbouring Uttar Pradesh. Earlier, this month, senior Samajwadi Party leader and 10-time MLA Azam Khan’s son lost his MLA seat and was disqualified from contesting elections for six years after being sentenced for two years for blocking traffic in 2008. Azam Khan had met the same fate last year in connection with a 2019 hate speech case.advertisementIn the bypoll for Rampur, which Azam Khan started winning in 1980, a Hindu, a BJP candidate, won for the first time. Notably, the BJP snatched power from the Samajwadi Party in 2017 and created history in retaining the state last year. While Azam Khan’s disqualification came at the fag end of his political career, the blow to the AAP, if at all it comes, will come when the party is on electoral ascendancy and might open a slight window that the BJP needs to end its humiliating run in Delhi.Back to Delhi. The AAP-BJP issue has been multi-pronged. Kejriwal’s government in the national capital and the Lieutenant Governor, who reports to the Centre, have been fighting over territorial control for years. While both sides have tried to discredit each other, governance has been a significant casualty.  
PUNJAB PROBLEMAnd problems for the AAP have not been confined to Delhi. AAP MLA from Punjab's Bathinda Rural seat Amit Rattan Kotfatta has been arrested in a bribery case by the Vigilance Bureau. Last year, AAP’s Punjab minister Vijay Sangla was dismissed and arrested in an alleged corruption case. And in January this year, another minister, Fauja Singh Sarari, resigned over allegations of corruption.advertisementAs it is, self-styled religious preacher Amritpal Singh’s challenge to the Punjab Police has come as a major headache for the AAP government in the state bordering Pakistan. On Thursday, hundreds of his supporters, armed with guns and swords, ran over a police station in Amritsar and clashed with cops, which led to the release of his associate.NO CONGRESS SUPPORTWhile many anti-BJP parties have condemned Sisodia’s arrest, such words have not come from the Congress. In fact, the Delhi unit of the grand old party has welcomed the arrest, which is not really surprising given the frosty relationship between Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and Arvind Kejriwal. The AAP was not even invited as part of a recent show of strength by “like-minded” parties in Kashmir where Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Yatra from Kanyakumari concluded.The welcoming of Sisodia’s arrest by the Congress could be a blessing for the BJP ahead of 2024 as the grand old party underlined its key meeting in Raipur on Sunday the plank of Opposition unity to fight the saffron brigade. It also shows the party’s inconsistency in calling the CBI and Enforcement Directorate as the BJP’s political tools to settle scores with its opponents.Be that as it may, 2024 is still quite a distance away. The question is, will Kejriwal be tied down in corruption cases facing his colleagues? Or will he gain from a sympathy wave that he expects will pick up soon? Expect more fireworks as India’s state poll cycle moves from the northeast to the Hindi heartland and down south.

The court contended ""the said scheme was introduced in national interest and to ensure that armed forces are better equipped"".The court had reserved its verdict on the batch of pleas on December 15 last year.In July, the Supreme Court asked the high courts of Kerala, Punjab and Haryana, Patna, and Uttarakhand to transfer the pleas against the scheme to the Delhi high court or keep them pending till a decision is delivered. In August, the Delhi high court said it would hear the matter instead of passing an interim order. The Union government told the court in October that recruitment in the military is an essential sovereign function keeping national security in mind. The Delhi High Court on Monday dismissed a batch of petitions challenging the Agnipath scheme and seeking resumption and enrolment as per the previous recruitment scheme in Indian defence services.Agnipath scheme The Agnipath scheme, unveiled on June 14, 2022, lays out rules for the recruitment of youth in the armed forces.According to these rules, those between 17-and-a-half and 21 years of age are eligible to apply and they would be inducted for a four-year tenure. The scheme allows 25 per cent of them to be granted regular service subsequently. After the scheme was unveiled, protests erupted in several states against the scheme.Later, the government extended the upper age limit to 23 years for recruitment in 2022.

Lamba speaking in the Congress Plenary said, ""I had a chance to speak with Sonia Gandhi ji for two minutes. Madam, your comment yesterday was interpreted as taking retirement from politics. I am happy to share that Sonia ji told me that we will continue to get her blessings and guidance in the future"". Lamba said that this is to inform the delegates and the nation that Sonia Gandhi is “not retiring from politics.”

While addressing the 85th All India Congress Committee (AICC) plenary session on Saturday, former Congress chief Sonia Gandhi launched an all-out attack on the BJP government, accusing it of ""fuelling the fire of hatred"" and ""viciously targeting minorities, women, Dalits and tribals"".

She was speaking after the party passed a Resolution of Appreciation for her as the plenary marked a formal end to the 25-year stint as the Congress president — the longest ever in the party.

""Our victories in 2004 and 2009 along with the able leadership of Dr Manmohan Singh gave me personal satisfaction but what gratifies me most is that my innings could conclude with the Bharat Jodo Yatra,"" said Sonia Gandhi while addressing the party`s 85th Plenary session in Raipur on Saturday.

She said that the Yatra has come as a turning point for Congress. It has proved that the people of India overwhelmingly want harmony, tolerance and equality, she added. ""It (Yatra) has renewed the rich legacy of dialogue between our party and the public through a mass contact program. It has shown us that the Congress stands with the people and is ready to fight for them,"" said Gandhi while congratulating the party workers for working hard for the Yatra.
Gandhi thanked all leaders, and the people of the country for participation in the Yatra and for love and support. ""I especially thank Rahul ji whose determination and leadership was crucial in the Yatra`s success,"" she said.

Sonia Gandhi said she was happy that her innings could conclude with the Bharat Jodo Yatra, with the party asserting that the remark was about her tenure as the party president and had nothing to do with her retirement from politics.

The Congress Steering Committee unanimously decided not to hold elections to the Congress Working Committee (CWC) and authorised party chief Mallikarjun Kharge to nominate its members.

Kharge said his party is willing to forge a viable alternative by aligning with like-minded parties in order to get rid of the ""anti-people"" BJP government in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls and is ready to make any sacrifice required to achieve the goal.
The Congress said it is the only party that can provide capable and decisive leadership to the country, but is ready to make sacrifices to defeat the BJP-led NDA and would go all out to identify, mobilise and align like-minded secular forces to achieve its goal.

The Congress carried out 85 amendments in its constitution at its plenary session to provide 50 per cent reservation to Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs), Other Backward Classes (OBCs), women, youth and minorities in its working committee and at all party positions.Live TvSonia GandhiSonia Gandhi retirementAlka LambaCongressCongress Plenary SessionRahul GandhiMallikarjun KhargeMore Stories Live updates LIVE Updates | Court Sends Sisodia To CBI Remand Till March 4 BA Student UP Exam Shocker!

Well, it can always be cooler. The OnePlus 11 Concept, a jazzed-up version of the recently launched OnePlus 11, is indeed that. And over here at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, it is dazzling visitors.  AdvertisementAman RashidBarcelona ,UPDATED: Feb 27, 2023 18:03 ISTIn ShortOnePlus showcased its latest innovation, OnePlus 11 Concept, in Barcelona.The OnePlus 11 Concept is based on the OnePlus 11.The OnePlus 11 Concept brings PC-like liquid cooling tech to a smartphone.By Aman Rashid: It's that time of the year when the people who write and report on all that latest in the world of smartphone gather in Barcelona. The occasion? Mobile World Congress. Yesterday, at a pre-MWC event, OnePlus showcased its latest concept. The phone -- OnePlus 11 Concept -- as its name suggests is a concept device, which means, it won't be commercially available for purchase. And that is a pity because the OnePlus 11 Concept looks, and supposedly runs, coolest. It's a looker and makes me sad that in a world where it exists, even as a concept, we have to make do with regular phones.advertisementAfter the OnePlus event, I had a chance to take a closer look at the OnePlus 11 Concept. While, as I noted, this is a not a phone that is going on sale, it does have tech that we expect to see in future market-ready OnePlus phones. So, let's talk about it in a bit of detail. The main focus of the phone is to enhance sustained performance, which is enabled by PC-like liquid cooling technology. 
OnePlus 11 Concept: First impressions Initially, when I first saw the leaks and teasers of the OnePlus 11 Concept, I had dismissed the phone for having LEDs attached to the back, just like the Nothing Phone 1, and that's about it. I thought to myself, what would be the concept here, with blue party lights attached to the back? To think of it, I was so wrong. Of course, at first glance, the rear of the OnePlus 11 Concept looks cool, as you see these pipelines of blue light flowing across the rear of the phone. But there's so much more to it than just the pretty lights.The OnePlus 11 Concept introduces the industry's first Active Cryo Flux cooling technology in a smartphone, which in simple terms means you're getting PC-like liquid cooling in the palm of your hands in this compact device called your smartphone. So, how this tech works? OnePlus has fitted two micropumps around the camera region, which sucks the heat generated from the chipset. That heat is then dissipated via the icy-cold liquid that is flowing through the visible pipelines in blue. Sounds cool, and looks even cooler! Now, OnePlus claims that with the liquid cooling tech on the OnePlus 11 Concept, one will be able to game efficiently, with the temperatures decreasing by up to 2.1 degrees Celsius, thus improving the frame rate by 3-4 FPS during gameplay. Additionally, while charging also, the cooling tech can bring the phone's temperature down by up to 1.6 degrees Celsius, shaving off 30-45s from the charging time. 
Of course, this being a hurried event -- like the way are at the MWC -- we didn't get to see any demos of the claims that the company made, but what I did get to see was the phone in person. And apart from the practical benefits the liquid cooling technology brings to the table, the OnePlus 11 Concept is a thing of beauty to gaze at.advertisementThe rear of the OnePlus 11 Concept is fitted with transparent glass, that features quad-curved corners. And since it is a transparent glass, you get to see all the liquid-cooling action right in front of your eyes as you hold the phone with its back facing towards you. I would also like to mention, that practicality aside, the OnePlus 11 Concept is a looker and especially the blue halo ring around the camera only adds to the character of the phone. But, again, one should not forget that more than the looks, the blue lights actually hold relevance and function. 
With all said, the OnePlus 11 Concept is a ""concept"" phone, like concept cars. It is not for sale. It is based on the OnePlus 11, though. Although the company did not comment on the specs or features, it is safe to assume that on the inside, the concept phone is the OnePlus 11. This means you are likely to have the same Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 SoC under the hood, LPDDR5X RAM and UFS 4.0 storage along with OxygenOS 13 at the helm.--- ENDS ---Also Read |  Thief exploits iPhone’s security feature to rob woman of Rs 8 lakh, here is what happenedAlso Read |  Xiaomi 13 Pro launched ahead of MWC 2023: check price, specs, and all other detailsAlso Read |  Nokia G22, C32 and C22 launched with up to three days of battery life, details here

Advanced applications, modern equipment, softwares are all assisting in innovation.

Many youngsters are heading towards great success these days with the help of technology. Digitalization everywhere is making this happen. And, here solopreneur Sagar Bhardwaj is making a mark with his exclusive skills.

Sagar Bharadwaj is a 22 year old boy from Rajouri, Jammu and Kashmir. Interestingly he has studied engineering but his passion was towards marketing. As any middle class boy will have, Sagar also has experienced all those ups and downs in his childhood as he belonged to a middle class family. So, his beginning was decent.

Initially his friends used to mock him when he used to talk about his dream and venture in college. There was no one who could believe that he’ll be a successful solopreneur. But his belief system was so strong that nothing could deteriorate that.

From being a zero to a boy who earns more than 70 lakhs and generates more that 7 crores for their clients, Sagar has come a long way. But it all started when he was 18 years old. Sagar didn’t want to sit inside the cubicle and spend 10 hours a day as a traditional employee. In fact he doesn’t even believe in that. Instead he wanted to be a solopreneur who chooses his working hours as and when he needs.

But luck was not in favor of him when he started his ideas into existence. He tried and tested many businesses but nothing worked for him. But that resilience that he doesn’t want to work under anybody was keeping his efforts constant. So he didn’t give up.

One fine day he decided to learn digital marketing and build his career around that. Since that was the time that digital marketing was booming like anything and was making way all through, he foresaw the upcoming opportunities in that, he learnt the necessary skills required to sail through this competitive world. Moreover he put all his past experience into a litmus test in order to give a big shot. He pursued his engineering degree along with a side hustle.

After his studies, he devoted himself completely to digital marketing. He started getting sweet fruits from his venture. He was working with the clients across the globe while sitting on his bed. He created a bunch of offers and packaged them as core services. By this time Sagar had a sound knowledge in content creation, website creation, landing pages, SEO and generating organic leads for high ticket products for his clients.

He has all the skills of the 22nd century that are quintessential to survive. Moreover he had a right mindset backed with a systematic approach. That’s the secret sauce of success. His thoughts were clear. He knew what he was doing. He started exploring market science, psychology and sales theories. Marketing became his favorite topic. He started learning the high income skills from pros in the respective field.

Sagar’s dream was big. He never wanted to be a 9-6 employee. His line of thinking has always been different. So he took his own path of being an entrepreneur and believed in his might and skills. Fortunately his hard and smart work held his hands.
Sagar also strongly believes that reading motivational books and philanthropists writings, will infuse a great amount of inspiration within you. He personally has read life changing books like Rich dad, poor dad, and the psychology of money, the secret by Rhonda and others. He says these books have had a real impact on him and on his mindset.

His overall journey from middle class boy to the most successful digital marketer, has stood like testament for his growth. His story has been inspirational for everyone who wants to make a mark in life. His life is an example of how one can become successful in life overtaking all the obstacles.

Believing one's passion and living it day and night can bear the sweet fruits. Sheer dedication puts you in the success basket.

People, left, right, and center are taking the plunge and getting hitched. Newly-weds have turned social media feeds into an extravagant wedding album. And while we have touched upon the topic of Indian weddings, how can the great Indian wedding show be complete without the unique types of baaratis and ladkiwalas joining the wedding shenanigans.advertisementFrom the nosy aunties who want singles to settle down soon, and the over-enthusiastic best man who is going to lose his best friend to a girl, to the girls who have taken upon them to turn the wedding into nothing less than a dance gala; there are countless types of wedding guests.Apart from these, there’s one type of guests, which most people are scared of. And these are the unannounced guests. These people had prior commitments, or stayed too far to attend the wedding. But, guess what, they arrived for the functions and how! Nevertheless, we Indians are always prepared for the worst at weddings- there’s always ample of food, plates, and arrangements to accommodate as many loved and not so loved ones as needed.The same scenario happened with HDFC’s Missing Dulha. The aunt from Bhopal arrived just when the groom went missing. But come what, the family was prepared to add more plates for the aunt and the family, similar to HDFC Click 2 Super, wherein there is flexibility to increase and decrease the life cover as per need.When we can be so willing to leave room for the unexpected at weddings, then why not with term plans?Introducing HDFC Life Click 2 Protect SuperJust like some guests come unannounced so can shock and surprise elements in life.

Daughter of a bakery employee, Old City’s first woman commercial pilot, Salva Fatima, dared to dream, despite wallowing in poverty and growing up in a neighbourhood of Moghalpura, where piped drinking water is still a dream for residents. Fatima is also among a handful of Muslim women in India to hold a commercial pilot licence.This hijab-wearing cockpit girl remained steadfast in her faith and refused to be shackled by the overbearing conservatism of society or cowed down by financial constraints. Her father, Syed Ashfaq Ahmed, lovingly calls her the “miracle girl” and not without reason. While studying at Neo School Aizza, Malakpet, she was on the verge of dropping out of class as her fees were unpaid, but her principal, Mrs Alifia Hussain, turned Good Samaritan and funded her education for two crucial years.Fatima was the eldest of four siblings and her father’s earnings from the job at a local bakery were meagre. Adversity struck again, when she was pursuing her Intermediate course at St. Ann's Junior College, Mehdipatnam. Her unpaid dues had spiralled and Fatima was on the verge of calling it quits.Forced to stand in the fee defaulter’s queue in sweltering heat, she was suddenly noticed by a botany professor, Mrs Sangeeta, who took her aside and vowed to pay her fees. Another guiding angel had saved her day. “She was God-sent. I didn’t know the professor personally, nor did she ever teach me,” says Fatima.A decade after first soaring into the skies on a Cessna Skyhawk at the Telangana Aviation Academy, Fatima is currently a First Officer with a top private airline and flies the Airbus-320, a narrow body jet variation of the Boeing 737 and is gearing up to fly with the imposing A380 fleet.But, despite the aviation industry’s glamourous connotations of dreamy overseas destinations, gourmet food or dapper passengers, this iron-willed girl never lost her moorings and remained firmly grounded, even while cruising at 30,000 feet and above. “The sky fascinated me.I always wanted to be a pilot, but could never afford a plane ticket. And my first flight was from the cockpit, not from a passenger’s seat,” she says with a humble smile. Though she hasn’t ever overshot the runway or hit a hard-landing, Fatima admits touchdown is the tougher part of a pilot’s job, particularly in inclement weather. But her biggest challenge now is balancing her high-flying career and family.A mother of two, the youngest being a six-month-old daughter, Fatima never misses the stark message embossed on the cockpit door — Flying is a serious profession, do not carry your worries beyond this point. And every time, the mother in her tears at the heartstrings, the blunt message echoes in her mind and transforms her into the hardened aviator. “My parents, husband and in-laws have always been supportive.That’s why I could live my dream,” she says. Also, she’s lucky to have never faced gender or religious discrimination. “I wear a hijab gifted by my airline. There’s no bias,” she says. And while she cherishes every moment of a smooth take-off and landing, her flight to success was not without turbulence. And every time she was tossed into darkness, she rose like a phoenix. “God willing, I was never alone in my journey. There were so many people who helped me on my way.”While a noted Old City journo and philanthropist financed her stint at the aviation academy in 2007, the KCR-led Telangana government passed a GO in 2015 offering Rs 35 lakh scholarship for her multi-engine endorsement and DGCA type rating to make her eligible to fly an Airbus or Boeing.And she upgraded her skills at foreign aviation academies in New Zealand and Bahrain, before she bagged a pilot’s licence and landed a job with a top airline. “My elder daughter, Maryam Fatima Shakaib, is a blessing as I got my government scholarship just after her birth. Now, my priority is to educate my daughters and build my house in Hyderabad. I will work harder so that my kids don’t face the struggles that I endured. Also, I will never quit Old City for plush locales in Banjara or Jubilee Hills. This is where I belong. This is where I achieved,” says Fatima. No wonder, Moghalpura’s pilot girl is an icon for millions of girls in Hyderabad.Start a ConversationFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIAFacebookTwitterInstagramKOO APPYOUTUBE Visual Stories  Sunny Leone stuns in lehengasEntertainmentFarzi actor Shahid Kapoor’s secret to ripped physiqueLifestyleHere's what Ambanis wore for bash at Isha Ambani's homeLifestyle11 times Alia Bhatt proved she is a poster girl for mini dressesEntertainmentScenic hill stations in Uttarakhand for your March traveltravelShraddha Arya's versatile western outfitstvAnanya Panday’s food photos from Doha have left us cravingFoodRRR's list of award wins ahead of Oscars 2023EntertainmentIn pics: Samantha completes 13 years in TollywoodEntertainment123ElectionsErode Election LiveNagaland Election 2023 LiveBypolls 2023 LiveMeghalaya Election 2023 LiveNagaland Exit PollsTripura Election ResultMeghalaya Exit PollsNagaland Election ResultsTop TrendingErode Bypoll LiveTejas ExpressIndia vs AustraliaShivamogga AirportMeghalaya Election 2023Nagaland Election 2023Trending StoriesIn CityEntire WebsiteMan found murdered, mobile helps cops catch killerTelangana clocks 7 new cases of CovidBoy dances in baraat, suffers heart attack, diesMedico loses battle for life, sparks fly at NIMSDenied hostel in EFLU, student sits in protestISB's Chief Digital Officer Programme'Centre to leverage G20 presidency to boost India's global clout'Six feared drowned as boat capsizes in pond in APCJI offers prayers at Srisailam temple in APTirupati police arrests 3 red sanders' smugglersDelhi excise policy: What CBI asked Manish Sisodia during 8-hour questioningLive: Sisodia likely to be produced before court at 2pmHow you could have made money out of Adani stocksLive: K'taka has scaled new heights of development, says PMEnjoy the luxury of recliner seats on Tejas ExpressMaulana Azad missing from Congress ad; deliberate, say Muslim netasIs Amritpal Singh Punjab's Bhindranwale 2.0?Isle of Man cricket team dismissed for 10 runsParticipate in the Times EdTech SurveyWant players to express themselves: SRH captain MarkramAbout usCreate Your Own AdTerms of Use and Grievance Redressal Policy Privacy policyAdvertise with usRSSNewsletterFeedbackePaperSitemapArchivesFOLLOW US ONOther Times Group News SitesThe Economic TimesHindi Economic TimesNavbharat TimesMaharashtra TimesVijaya KarnatakaTelugu SamayamTamil SamayamMalayalam SamayamEi SamayI am GujaratTimesPointsIndiatimesBrand CapitalEducation TimesTimes FoodMiss KyraMumbai MirrorBangalore MirrorPopular CategoriesHeadlinesSports NewsBusiness NewsIndia NewsWorld NewsBollywood NewsHealth & Fitness TipsIndian TV ShowsCelebrity PhotosHot on the WebK Vishwanaths Death NewsHrithik RoshanHoney GingerBollywood CouplesBaby NamesRakhi SawantSachin Shroff WeddingVastu TipsRakesh SujathasShehnaaz GillTop TrendsErode Bypoll LiveTejas ExpressIndia vs AustraliaShivamogga AirportMeghalaya Election 2023Nagaland Election 2023Aiden MarkramManish Sisodia ArrestBypolls 2023 LiveArvind KejriwalNEET PG 2023CBSE Board Exam 2023Bank Holidays in MarchMeghalaya Election Exit PollsNagaland Election Exit PollsTripura Election ResultCryptocurrency Price in IndiaIPL Schedule 2023Trending TopicsParineeti ChopraParenting TipsRelationships TipsShark Tank India 2Rich Dosa RecipesGondola Rides In VeniceOld FridgeMushroom BenefitsSAG Awards 2023Heart DiseasesBest Food For HealthGenelia D'SouzaBollywood Actor TransformationsShanthi PriyaKottayam Nazeer Health NewsBollywood CelebritiesVivo Y55sLaptops under 30000WiFi RoutersTablets under 15000Living and entertainmentiDivaMensXP.comFeminaETimesGraziaZoomTravel DestinationsBombay TimesCricbuzz.comFilmfareOnline SongsTVLifestyleLongwalks AppNewspaper SubscriptionFood NewsTimes PrimeWhats HotServicesCouponDuniaMagicbricksTechGigTimesJobsBollywood NewsTimes MobileGadgets NowCareersColombiaCopyright © 2023 Bennett, Coleman & Co.

India NewsPress Trust of IndiaUpdated: February 27, 2023 4:21 pm ISTThe Tagore Grove Memorial has a life-size bronze statue of Tagore, unveiled in 2013.Houston: The Tagore Memorial Grove and walking museum, one of the first in the United States to spread the message of Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore's borderless world, has been inaugurated here in Texas.Tagore Grove, a free and open-air, permanent memorial of the poet's words and thoughts, depicting his message of love, universalism and a borderless world, was inaugurated on Saturday at the Ray Miller Park in Houston in the presence of the enthusiastic diaspora, complete with Vedic chants, presentation and recitation of Tagore's musical compositions.Several public officials attended the unveiling, including the Consul General of India in Houston, Aseem Mahajan, Fort bend County Judge K P George, and Fort bend Commissioner Andy Myers.Prof Jon Boles, retired Professor of American History at Rice University, Congressional Staffers of US Rep. Al Green, D-Houston, US Rep Lizzie Fletcher, and officials representing Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner also attended the event.The memorial is a collaboration between the Tagore Society of Houston (TSH) and the City of Houston Parks Department.""The Tagore Grove Memorial has a life-size bronze statue of Tagore, unveiled in 2013, which is the only sixth full figure statue of the poet erected outside his birthplace, Kolkata, India, and the first in the US"", TSH President Gopendu Chakrabarti said while highlighting Tagore's message of universalism and world peace.""This is a fitting monument,"" Counsel General Mahajan said while elaborating on the relevance of Tagore's travels, writings and visions of international brotherhood in today's world, and in Houston in particular, with it being a melting pot of different cultures.""The memorial will have a strong connect with the city of Houston and will add to the diversity of the city. I'm sure it will promote its objective of promoting cultural exchanges and mutual understanding,"" Mahajan said.""India and the United States share a comprehensive global strategic partnership which touches all areas of human endeavour, like energy security, defence, trade and investment and growing people-to-people ties,"" he said.""The timing of the inauguration is significant as it coincides with India's celebration of 75 years of independence (Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav) and marks 102 years of the opening of Viswa Bharati, the world university founded by Tagore,"" he added.Fort Bend County Judge George spoke highly of Tagore's contribution as a poet, philosopher, composer and social reformer. ""His writings are still relevant and impact lives in this time and age"", he said.Houston Mayor Turner presented a proclamation appreciating the effort and passion behind starting the memorial and dedicated February 25 as Tagore Memorial Day.The TSH received special congressional recognition from the representatives of Congressman Al Green and Congresswoman Lizzie Fletchers.A soulful rendition of songs and works of the poet was presented at the event.""This iconic Tagore Grove memorial seeks to be a permanent place for 'peace and introspection' for individuals and the community at large, comparable in potential impact as the Lincoln Memorial or the Statue of Liberty, and it is hoped that it will inspire visitors to make the world a better place for themselves and the coming generations,"" Chakrabarti told PTI.TSH, established in 1974 to spread humanistic philosophy and the universal message of Tagore as its primary and only mission, is a non-religious and non-sectarian organisation. In 2013, it completed the first phase of Tagore Grove at Ray Miller Park, complete with a full-size statue of Tagore. In 2020, it initiated the second phase of the Grove, a USD 300,000 upgrade, to convert the Grove into a free open-air memorial.PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.comAs part of the yearlong celebration of the inauguration of the Tagore Memorial and 75 years of India's independence, TSH will conduct a Peace Concert close to Tagore's birthday in May.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)Featured Video Of The Day""My Decision To Quit Politics, Nobody Forced Me"": BS Yediyurappa To NDTVAlso ReadOld Video: CEO Takes Shots From AK-47 To Prove His Bulletproof Cars Really WorkGrain Silos As Airbnb?

A bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Subramonium Prasad dismissed a batch of petitions assailing the scheme and said there was no reason to interfere with it.

The court also dismissed petitions relating to the recruitment process for the armed forces under certain previous advertisements while clarifying that such candidates do not have a right to seek recruitment. The court had reserved its verdict on the batch of pleas on December 15 last year.

The Agnipath scheme, unveiled on June 14, 2022, lays out rules for the recruitment of youth in the armed forces. According to these rules, those between 17-and-a-half and 21 years of age are eligible to apply and they would be inducted for a four-year tenure. The scheme allows 25 percent of them to be granted regular service subsequently. After the scheme was unveiled, protests erupted in several states against the scheme. Later, the government extended the upper age limit to 23 years for recruitment in 2022.Live Tvagnipath recruitmentagnipath schemeChief Justice Satish Chandra Sharmaagnipath recruitment newsMore Stories Live updates LIVE Updates | Court Sends Sisodia To CBI Remand Till March 4 BA Student UP Exam Shocker!

It allows you to add your spouse and dependent or legally adopted children, while some of them facilitate you to add your parents and parents-in-law as well. While there are various plans available in the market, choosing the best might be hard. Here are a few important factors that will help choose the best Family Floater Health Insurance policy.advertisementRequirementsIt is important to know your requirements in the first place, only then you can look for a policy that covers your essential needs. Be clear about how many family members you are planning to include under the Family Floater Health Insurance policy. Buying a separate policy for parents and parents-in-law is a wise decision as the health needs of elderly people may differ. Do not miss out to address health conditions like pre-existing diseases or illnesses and other health complications of your family members, if any. Knowing the requirements will give a clear vision of what is best for you. Policy InclusionCheck for policy inclusions, as it is important to know all the details of policy inclusions to check if they satisfies all your needs. Make sure your opted policy covers all the essential policy benefits such as in-patient hospitalization, pre- and post-hospitalization, day care treatments, ambulance charges, room rent, ICU charges, annual health check-ups, etc. Knowing the policy inclusions will dispel the claim-related queries and make you aware of your policy. The policy inclusion differs from one policy to other. Compare and choose the policy that best suits your requirements.  
Sum Insured While choosing the Sum Insured, keep in mind that the same will be shared between all the family members. So, choose a Sum Insured that will be adequate for all the family members, and also be mindful that the selected Sum Insured should be sufficient to cover the medical bills if more than one member is hospitalized at the same time. Opting for a higher Sum Insured might cause you a high premium, in such cases, consider purchasing a Top-up Health Insurance policy. Therefore, you can get the Sum Insured of your basic policy enhanced at an affordable premium. Add-on CoversAdd-on covers are optional benefits provided with the opted Health Insurance policy. Lump sum for diagnosis of cancer, rider for the waiting period, personal accident cover, daily hospital cash, etc., are some of the add-on benefits offered by the insurance company. These add-ons are policy specific, some policies may provide them while some may neglect them. Compare the policy and opt for a flexible one that offers the add-on cover that suits your requirements. The add-on will not come under the standard features of the policy, they can be availed with an additional premium. Before opting for the add-on consider your family’s medical history and health risks to decide which add-on will suit you better. advertisementClaim Settlement RatioThe claim settlement ratio should be considered a valuable factor when choosing an insurance company. Because theis ratio defines the claims settled by the company out of the total number of claims filed. Choose a company that has a high claim settlement ratio. Also give equal importance to the claim process offered by the company, knowing the claim process is essential because it will be easy for you to file the claim. Besides the above-mentioned factors, check for the policy benefits like cumulative or no-claim bonus, automatic restoration, recharge benefit, annual health check-up, online premium discount, etc. These benefits might come handy when you need them most. Star Health and Allied Insurance Co Ltd offers an array of flexible Health Insurance policies for the family to ensure that the need of every family member is addressed. Give importance to the minute details of policy clauses and documents to be assured that your investment is for the best.

The conclusion is due to new intelligence, but the department made its judgment with “low confidence,” according to people who have read the classified report, the WSJ said.AFPUS National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said Sunday there’s “a variety of views” in the US intelligence community about whether the virus originated naturally or in a lab and he “can’t confirm or deny” the Wall Street Journal report. A laboratory leak was the most likely origin of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to findings by the US Energy Department, the Wall Street Journal reported. A classified intelligence report provided to the White House and key members of Congress said the virus likely spread due to a mishap at a Chinese laboratory, the WSJ reported on Sunday. The Energy Department had previously been undecided on the source of the virus. The conclusion is due to new intelligence, but the department made its judgment with “low confidence,” according to people who have read the classified report, the WSJ said. US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said Sunday there’s “a variety of views” in the US intelligence community about whether the virus originated naturally or in a lab and he “can’t confirm or deny” the Wall Street Journal report. President Joe Biden has asked the US’s National Laboratories, which are part of the Energy Department, to be part of the assessment, Sullivan said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “And if we gain any further insight or information, we will share it with Congress and we will share it with the American people,” he said. “But, right now, there is not a definitive answer that has emerged from the intelligence community on this question.” China has long hit back at any suggestion that the Covid-19 virus originated in a lab. The Chinese Embassy in Washington didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment outside regular working hours.Don’t miss out on ET Prime stories!

Hopes were high among Indian fans as they flocked to the Hyderabad Street Circuit to see the race in person. Even more eyes were glued to mobile and TV screens, watching with enthusiasm as the lights went out. It was looking like a good weekend for Jaguar TCS Racing Team as one of their drivers, Mitch Evans started from pole and was hanging onto the lead during the opening laps. However, an unfortunate turn of events led to him being taken out by his own teammate Sam Bird. But that was just a taste of how unpredictable motorsports can be and there were more twists and turns ahead.Mitch Evans, Jaguar TCS Racing talks about Hyderabad Street Circuit & racing | 2023 Formula E seasonA number of drivers suffered crashes and collisions while others moved up and down the order. The margins were tight and the cars close to each other. Jean-Eric Vergne of DS Penske waited patiently for the right moment and then sprang into first place. He was quick to adapt to the new track but the battle was not over yet. As he reached the last two laps, the battery level in his car was sitting at 1%. On top of this, he had two Envision Racing cars on his tail and up ahead was a chance to get his first Formula E win since Season 7. An average person would be sweating through their palms in such a situation and with the stakes being so high.Pascal Wehrlein crashed his Porsche during FP1Inside the driver's helmetJean-Eric Vergne took his first victory of the season in Hyderabad“I was actually very calm”, is what Jean-Eric Vergne had to say about his state of mind during those final few laps of the race. This short answer tells you everything you need to know about the level at which these athletes operate. The French driver managed to get this win despite having some trouble with the braking on his car. He explained, “I was not able to have very good braking because it was very inconsistent. When I was behind Mitch in the beginning, I almost hit him a couple of times because I lost the brakes in some parts of the braking zone.”The struggle with the brakes meant that Vergne had to be extra cautious while going around the track and also manage his regen system. “Because of the issue I was having, I was not recuperating enough energy. So, I had to find some ways to lift earlier in some places. Try and save more energy in some places while keeping the others behind.”, said Vergne.Talking about the slim margins in terms of battery charge, the Frenchman said, “The way you see things on TV, the 1%, 4% (of charge), that's not something I see in the car. What I see is the energy remaining and I knew that when I was going on the last lap, I had the same amount of energy as the lap before. Basically, I knew where I had to lift to make it through the finishing line. And when I crossed the finishing line, one meter later I had no power. That's something we train for in the simulator, to finish with no energy because we are in the view that if you finish the race with three extra per cent of energy, this is a three per cent that was not used in the race.” A spectacle for fansThe Hyderabad e-Prix drew in more than 25,000 people and showed the world of Formula E that there are plenty of fans of the sport in India. The race itself was hailed as one of the best in recent times and the extremely close gap between cars towards the final few laps only added to the excitement of the viewersTricks and turnsWhen asked about his impressions of the track, Vergne answered, “The track itself was quite nice. Once it got cleaned away by the cars, the track was actually fun to drive. I liked the layout with all kinds of high-speed and medium-speed corners. The only issue really was the first chicane made it impossible for the FIA to really monitor well the track limit situation.”The chicane at Turn 1 and 2 was so tight that most cars ended up crossing track limits in order to maintain pace. Vergne along with some other drivers expressed concerns about maintaining track limits. Before the start of the Free Practice sessions, Sam Bird of Jaguar TCS Racing Team had also spoken about the chicane, “What Formula E has created at Turn 1 & 2 is a very, very fast chicane and I feel that it will be a difficult area to police track limits. It is also an area where the cars could be damaged”. This concern turned out to be true as many drivers got warnings for crossing track limits at the chicane during the qualifying and race sessions. Vergen said, “And since everybody was doing it, it was hard not to do it. So I've had my three warnings like everyone else and then I made sure not to ever go above the limit. But yeah, that one corner was bad but nothing that they cannot fix.”The last-minute lapsBut the tricky chicane was not the only concern that was raised by Vergne, “Honestly I expected better from the infrastructure. I think that was not at a level where Formula E should operate. So I do hope that if we come back we see a clear significant improvement.” When asked about what he thought needed to be improved with regards to arrangements in India, Vergne said, “The whole infrastructure of the paddock, probably traffic management, a bit more communication from all aspects from the police to the organiser and just to get the track ready on time because when we arrived as teams, nothing was ready. Yeah, it was ready for the (race) day but when you think about it they knew long enough that we were coming and I just don't understand why it was ready so late. I mean there were not even toilets in the paddock. So, you know, all this kind of thing is so easy to implement if you work on time and I feel that it was done very last minute.”It is not just the drivers that felt that the event lacked in terms of management. A lot of fans who paid good money to watch the race were also complaining about the arrangements and how things were handled. Alberto Longo, co-founder of Formula E believes that the niggles are not unusual for the large part but did admit that a lot of the arrangements were finalised at the 11th hour. “We have a whole year to keep on working together but we cannot forget that (things were not as smooth) obviously and it is true that we basically finalised things very last minute. That was something that we raised to our partner, locally. But I am absolutely positive that in years to come, these will be a much smoother operation. The fact that we have a local partner who is very engaged and very passionate about doing the races there, I'm positive that it will be better and better every year as we have done in many other locations.”While there is no doubt that the race could have been managed in a better manner, one must also realise that hosting a world-class event like Formula E in India for the first time is no small feat. We do hope that the organisers learn from this experience and come back next year with more preparation so that all parties involved can enjoy the sport. “We all need to understand that the racetrack only 14 days ago was a completely different thing and then we transformed the heart of the beautiful city of Hyderabad into a permanent track. So, those are a lot of challenges and obviously, we try to minimise the disruption to the neighbourhoods and the people who are around and that does sometimes create some challenges. But again, nothing different than what we have had in cities like Hong Kong, Paris, Mexico, Rome, London, etc.”, said Longo.New track, new hope?Historically, Vergne has performed well on new tracks. He seems to adapt to brand-new environments much faster than some other drivers on the grid. When asked if new tracks were his speciality, Jean said, “I like new tracks because you have to work fast, understand things fast and I quite like that. Winning on a new track doesn't mean that you're going to win on another new track. All the work has to be redone for a different track.” The upcoming races in Cape Town & Sao Paulo are also brand-new additions to the calendar. So, we asked JEV if he was expecting more podium finishes in those races as well. He replied, “I would come with the same mentality as I came in India and just not overthink it. Just get out there try and do the best job possible and try to have fun at the same time.”Despite this encouraging win in Hyderabad, Vergne has not got his head in the clouds. He mentioned that the team still has work to do and the car has to be more competitive to get consistently good results. He said, “My goal at the moment is to improve this car so that we can be in a position to fight for the championship.” The Frenchman also said, “On a scale of 1 to 100, I would say that after the first three races we were probably at 20% with 100% being very hard to get to, especially in Formula E. But I think now we're more like, you know 60%, so we still have a big margin for improvement.”After India, Formula E is heading to Sao Paulo for the first-ever Formula E race there. This season has seen four new tracks being added to the race calendar in order to appeal to a wider audience. Regardless of the issues that the event had in India, I am sure that the teams, drivers and fans would love to revisit the Hyderabad Street Circuit to put up an even better show and perhaps make it a track that is well-known across the globe.About the AuthorAakash S.

Shinde made the sensational claim while speaking to reporters here on the eve of the Maharashtra Assembly's Budget session.

""I was a witness to the ongoing planning of the MVA government to arrest then leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis and Girish Mahajan. That government had even planned to invoke the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act 1999 against Mahajan. I cannot repeat what I had said that time to stop them,"" Shinde said.

""Instead of changing the decision, I later toppled the whole government and made them (MVA) sit at home. The strategy was to put the Bharatiya Janata Party on the backfoot (through the arrests),"" Shinde claimed.

When asked why his government was not taking action against those involved in this conspiracy, the CM said, ""Dethroning is enough for them. I am well aware of who was indulging in such practices. If required, we will initiate an inquiry into the matter.""

Fadnavis had made the claim about a plan to arrest him by the Uddhav Thackeray government during a media interaction in January this year.

However, the NCP's Dilip Walse Patil, who was a home minister under Thackeray, refuted this claim.

The agency will press for the AAP leader's custodial interrogation, stating that he did not co-operate. AdvertisementNalini SharmaNew Delhi,UPDATED: Feb 27, 2023 17:14 ISTDelhi Deputy CM Manish Sisodia (Photo: File)By Nalini Sharma: The Central Bureau of Investigation, which arrested Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia in the Delhi liquor scam, will press for the AAP leader's custodial interrogation, stating that he did not co-operate during the investigation. Manish Sisodia gave evasive replies during the probe, the CBI said in a statement.“The deputy chief minister gave evasive replies and did not co-operate with the investigation despite being confronted with evidence to the contrary. Therefore, he has been arrested. The arrested accused will be produced before the designated court in Delhi,” the agency had said in a statement.advertisementThe CBI sought answers from Sisodia on the changes made to the draft excise policy under his supervision. Legal sources close to the CBI told India Today that the first draft of the excise policy did not have multiple provisions that were later included in the final draft. The CBI is relying on a statement given by an official of the excise department who has allegedly stated that Sisodia was involved in including these contentious provisions in the final draft.The CBI had seized Sisodia’s digital devices to verify how these changes were made in the draft policy and whether it was done to benefit certain businessmen or not. ALSO READ | Gave evasive replies, didn't cooperate: What CBI said on Manish Sisodia's arrestThe agency will seek Manish Sisodia’s custody, stating that he has not been forthcoming about how these contentious provisions were included in the final excise policy when they weren’t part of the initial draft. The officials are also looking into the aspect of whether these suggestions came from someone outside the excise department.Manish Sisodia was arrested on Sunday evening by the CBI after eight hours of questioning for ‘criminal conspiracy’ and ‘intent to defraud’ under the Indian Penal Code and the Prevention of Corruption Act.“The instant case was registered against the Deputy Chief Minister and in-charge Excise Minister and 14 others for an investigation into the matter of alleged irregularities in framing and implementation of the excise policy for the year 2021-22 and extending post tender benefits to private persons. A chargesheet was filed on December 25, 2022 against the then CEO of a Mumbai-based private company and six others,” the agency said in a statement.

LONDON: British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and European Union leader Ursula von der Leyen are set to hold face-to-face talks, with expectations high they will seal a deal to resolve a thorny post-Brexit trade dispute. That would mark a breakthrough after months of bitter wrangling that has soured U.K.-EU relations, sparked the collapse of the Belfast-based regional government and and threatened to set back Northern Ireland's decades-old peace process. In a joint statement on Sunday the U.K. and the EU said European Commission President von der Leyen will travel to Britain on Monday so the leaders can work towards ""shared, practical solutions for the range of complex challenges around the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland."" U.K. Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab said earlier Sunday that the two sides were on the ""cusp"" of striking an agreement over trade rules known as the Northern Ireland Protocol. Northern Ireland is the only part of the U.K. that shares a border with an EU member, the Republic of Ireland. When the U.K. left the bloc in 2020, the two sides agreed to keep the Irish border free of customs posts and other checks because an open border is a key pillar of Northern Ireland's peace process. Instead there are checks on some goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the U.K. That angered British unionist politicians in Belfast, who say the new trade border in the Irish Sea undermines Northern Ireland's place in the United Kingdom.  The Democratic Unionist Party collapsed Northern Ireland's Protestant-Catholic power-sharing government a year ago in protest and has refused to return until the rules are scrapped or substantially rewritten. Relations between the U.K. and the EU, severely tested during years of Brexit wrangling, chilled still further amid disputes over the Northern Ireland Protocol. The British government introduced a bill that would let it unilaterally rip up parts of the Brexit agreement, a move the EU called illegal. The bloc accused the U.K. of failing to honor the legally binding treaty it had signed. The mood between London and Brussels improved after Sunak, a pragmatic Brexit supporter, took office in October, replacing more belligerent predecessors Boris Johnson and Liz Truss. Striking a deal would let Sunak ""get Brexit done"" in a way that eluded Johnson, who won a landslide election victory on that very slogan in 2019, three years after British voters narrowly opted in a referendum to leave the bloc. Johnson did lead the U.K. out of the now 27-nation EU in 2020, but with a divorce deal that left Northern Ireland still bound to some EU rules and standards in a way that caused headaches for businesses and upset Northern Ireland's delicate political balance. U.K. and EU negotiators have been inching towards a solution during weeks of intense talks, but any deal with the bloc carries political risk for Sunak. Hints of compromise towards the EU have sparked opposition from hard-line euroskeptics in Sunak's governing Conservative Party, including Johnson. The DUP also has warned it will oppose any deal that does not meet its demand for ""significant, substantive change."" A deal is likely to remove customs checks on the vast majority of goods moving between the U.K. and Northern Ireland. The thorniest issue is the role of the European Court of Justice in resolving any disputes that arise over the rules. Britain and the EU agreed in their Brexit divorce deal to give the European court that authority, but the DUP and Conservative Brexiteers insist the court must have no jurisdiction in U.K. matters. Sunak insisted a deal would meet unionist demands. ""As someone who believes in Brexit, voted for Brexit, campaigned for Brexit, I want to demonstrate that Brexit works and it works for every part of the United Kingdom,"" he told the Sunday Times. ""There's unfinished business on Brexit and I want to get the job done.""Don’t miss out on ET Prime stories!

The jail fight came days after self-styled Sikh preacher Amritpal Singh laid siege to Amritsar's Ajnala police station along with hundreds of weapon-wielding supporters who clashed with police for hours, leaving many cops injured.Preliminary investigations indicated that Sunday's prison clash occurred between groups owing allegiance to gangsters Lawrence Bishnoi and Goldy Brar and to gangster Jaggu Bhagwanpuria, SSP Chohan said.Toofan was alleged to be one of the standby shooters during Moose Wala's May 29 killing in Punjab's Mansa district and owed allegiance to the Bhagwanpuria group, sources said. Mohna, former president of Budhlada truck union, was accused by police to have kept a close watch on Moose Wala from January 2022 till his murder and had sheltered four persons involved in keeping a close eye on the singer.Formerly a member of Shiromani Akali Dal, Mohna joined Congress in January 2022, just a month ahead of the Punjab assembly elections, allegedly to keep a close watch on Moose Wala.Keshav allegedly had provided logistics support to the assassins.During Sunday's jail fight, sources said sharp-edged weapons, rods and even utensils were used. All three were lodged in an isolated zone of the high-security prison and had been allowed out of their cells for a while in line with jail rules around 3pm when the clash occurred, the senior superintendent of police (SSP) said. Sources claimed that the inmates first faced off over some issue and the situation soon took an ugly turn.The clash was essentially a fallout of differences among the gangsters, who had joined hands for Moose Wala's murder. The Lawrence-Goldy group allegedly suspected the Bhagwanpuria gang was leaking information to police and also suspected the gang's involvement in drug peddling.Start a ConversationFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIAFacebookTwitterInstagramKOO APPYOUTUBE Visual Stories  9 marriage habits for a smooth life togetherLifestyle18 Foods that naturally prevent CancerFoodGenelia D'Souza's Stylish LooksEntertainmentActors who underwent massive transformationEntertainmentPositive affirmations for your daughterLifestyleEye-catching looks of MiyatvCandid pics from Jabardasth fame Rakesh-Sujatha's Haldi and weddingtvPull off dreamy pastels like Kalyani PriyadarshanEntertainmentFrom Sid-Kiara to SRK-Gauri: Bollywood couples and their age gapEntertainment123ElectionsErode Election LiveNagaland Election 2023 LiveBypolls 2023 LiveMeghalaya Election 2023 LiveNagaland Exit PollsTripura Election ResultMeghalaya Exit PollsNagaland Election ResultsTop TrendingHoroscope TodayIndia vs AustraliaErode Bypoll LiveBypolls 2023 LiveNagaland Election LiveMeghalaya Election LiveTrending StoriesIn CityEntire WebsiteOver 500 delegates participate in 44th annual national conference of Forensic Medicon in AmritsarEvolution to Extinction: A craft exhibition that takes visitors to prehistoric timesMeet Amritpal Singh, the man some call Bhindranwale 2.0Maharashtra 'warning': Brace for stormy budget sessionRamgarh bypoll today, 144 of 405 booths hypersensitiveISB's Chief Digital Officer ProgrammeBengaluru lost Rs 517 crore to cybercrime since 2019Temperature continues to soar, air quality in Delhi remains 'poor'3 kids die in Kolkata of acute breathing distress, 1 of them from adenovirus'Sisodia is innocent, his arrest is dirty politics'Why Adani Total Gas has crashed over 80%, while Adani Ports has fallen just 27%Sisodia's arrest may throw a spanner in the works; AAP govt in spotHow institutional casteism ‘murdered’ this IIT studentMeghalaya election live: 10.55% voter turnout in 2 hoursNagaland election 2023 live updates: Voting under wayIndia vs Australia: Indore next pit stop in home dominanceWhy Haryana must defang its gau rakshaks​What makes Manish Sisodia so important?Russia praises 'constructive' role of India's G20 presidencyLive: Zelenskyy fires a top Ukrainian military commanderAbout usCreate Your Own AdTerms of Use and Grievance Redressal Policy Privacy policyAdvertise with usRSSNewsletterFeedbackePaperSitemapArchivesFOLLOW US ONOther Times Group News SitesThe Economic TimesHindi Economic TimesNavbharat TimesMaharashtra TimesVijaya KarnatakaTelugu SamayamTamil SamayamMalayalam SamayamEi SamayI am GujaratTimesPointsIndiatimesBrand CapitalEducation TimesTimes FoodMiss KyraMumbai MirrorBangalore MirrorPopular CategoriesHeadlinesSports NewsBusiness NewsIndia NewsWorld NewsBollywood NewsHealth & Fitness TipsIndian TV ShowsCelebrity PhotosHot on the WebK Vishwanaths Death NewsHrithik RoshanHoney GingerBollywood CouplesBaby NamesRakhi SawantSachin Shroff WeddingVastu TipsRakesh SujathasShehnaaz GillTop TrendsHoroscope TodayIndia vs AustraliaErode Bypoll LiveBypolls 2023 LiveNagaland Election LiveMeghalaya Election LiveManish Sisodia ArrestShivamogga AirportArvind KejriwalNEET PG 2023Kane WilliamsonCBSE Board Exam 2023Bank Holidays in MarchMeghalaya Election Exit PollsNagaland Election Exit PollsTripura Election ResultCryptocurrency Price in IndiaIPL Schedule 2023Trending TopicsOld FridgeSridevi PhotoShriya SaranShark Tank India 2Maanvi Gagroo Wedding PhotoGondola Rides In VeniceChatGPT Writing SkillsSelfiee ReviewHealthy FoodMilind SomanMaanvi Gagroo Wedding GuestJanhvi KapoorShah Rukh KhanRichest SingersVirat-Sonakshi Viral Dance VideoBollywood CelebritiesVivo Y55sLaptops under 30000WiFi RoutersTablets under 15000Living and entertainmentiDivaMensXP.comFeminaETimesGraziaZoomTravel DestinationsBombay TimesCricbuzz.comFilmfareOnline SongsTVLifestyleLongwalks AppNewspaper SubscriptionFood NewsTimes PrimeWhats HotServicesCouponDuniaMagicbricksTechGigTimesJobsBollywood NewsTimes MobileGadgets NowCareersColombiaCopyright © 2023 Bennett, Coleman & Co.

The arrest of Sisodia comes after that of Satyendar Jain, Delhi's the then health minister, in June last year. Both have led what the Aam Aadmi Party describes as the successful transformation of Delhi's education and health services, contributing to the party's popularity and continued electoral success. Their absence leaves Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal with no heavyweight lieutenant to implement his governance agenda in Delhi. The immediate challenge for Kejriwal is to present the Delhi government budget as scheduled and find Sisodia's replacement. Sources in the Aam Aadmi Party said Revenue Minister Kailash Gahlot may present the Delhi government budget for the next financial year.

""As there was a possibility that the deputy chief minister may be arrested by the CBI, Gahlot was attending budget-related meetings for the last few days.

""Gahlot is likely to present the 2023-24 budget. It is scheduled to be presented next month,"" an AAP functionary told PTI.

According to the Delhi government's websites, there are a total of 33 departments.

Of these, Sisodia looks after 18, including health, education, public works department (PWD), services, finance, power, home and urban development. He is also in charge of all other departments not specifically allotted to any minister.

Apart from Kejriwal, the Delhi government has six cabinet ministers, including jailed Satyendar Jain who is still a minister without a portfolio. Jain was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate last year in connection with a money laundering case.
Environment Minister Gopal Rai has only three departments while Imran Hussain is in charge of only two departments -- food and civil supplies, and election.

Kailash Gahlot is in charge of six departments, including revenue, and transport while Raj Kumar Anand has four portfolios.

The CBI on Sunday evening arrested Sisodia, who is close to Kejriwal, in connection with alleged corruption in the formulation and implementation of the now-scrapped excise policy for 2021-22 after nearly eight hours of questioning.

This was the second round of questioning of Sisodia after the agency registered a case on August 17 last year. He was quizzed on October 17 last year.
Kejriwal termed the arrest ""dirty politics"" and asserted that his deputy was innocent.

""Manish is innocent. His arrest is dirty politics. It has angered people quite a lot. People are watching everything. People now understand everything and will give reply to this. It will boost our spirit and our struggle will only get stronger,"" Kejriwal said in a tweet in Hindi.Live TvManish SisodiaArvind KejriwalAAPDelhi Excise Policy caseCBIMore Stories Live updates LIVE Updates | Court Sends Sisodia To CBI Remand Till March 4 BA Student UP Exam Shocker!

Suresh ChandraadvertisementPosing as agents of a fictitious murder suspect, the reporters met him twice.Chandra offered to falsify the forensic report in favour of the man the investigative reporters told him was accused of poisoning his victim.Also Read | Accused in Umesh Pal murder case killed in encounterCLEANING UP POISON IN FSL REPORTThe FSL chief at Varanasi demanded Rs 10 lakh for cleaning up the poison from record books.“Let me go through it (the case) tomorrow but seeing it will also cost -- a part payment of Rs 10,000 for checking the records, not the full amount yet,” he demanded. “We’ll start the process when the required fee is paid.”When the reporters met Chandra again at a luxury hotel in Varanasi the next day, the same official of the zone’s main forensic laboratory offered to set up a special team to forge FSL findings of viscera samples.“The case seems to have many signs of poisoning. The nails and lips (of the body) are blue,” he said. “Signs of poisoning are there. But we’ll put our job at stake. We’ll have to set up a team to do this. At least two to three people.”Also Read | SC extends Congress leader Pawan Khera's interim protection from arrestChandra asked for hard cash to create a team that he claimed would give a clean chit to the suspect in their report. “It will cost 10 (lakh) for (a team of) three people. Their report will be absolutely final. It will be signed off by two-three people. Team work cannot be challenged. It will stand (as valid) even in the Supreme Court,” Chandra boasted.According to the Varanasi FSL chief, the entire process would take one week. “So it (the payment) has to be received before the result (report),” he said.TAMPERING WITH DNA SAMPLESWhen probed further, Chandra also offered to help manipulate a DNA report at the FSL headquarters in Lucknow in connection with a rape case.“It will be done,” he claimed.“But it’s a rape case,” the reporter probed.Also Read | Sisodia arrested, no bail for Jain for months: But why jail taint isn’t the biggest challenge for AAPadvertisement“It will be done,” Chandra repeated. “Take the case details. It will cost as much (Rs 10 lakh). It (the case) should be encashed as soon as possible so that they (the suspects’ family) don’t get in touch with someone else.”MANIPUTLATING DOWRY DEATH EVIDENCEIn Agra, India Today’s investigative team met Sanjeev Dwivedi, a scientist at the FSL’s biology division in the city. 

Sanjeev DwivediAsked about the possibility of altering a viscera report in connection with a dowry death by poison, he offered to omit the lethal substance from the official findings if he was paid Rs 2,30,000.“The poison-laced viscera is already with you,” the reporter told Dwivedi.Also Read | What Shashi Tharoor said at the Congress plenary that no other party leader did“If you want to negate it, it will be done for Rs 250,000,” Dwivedi said. “We can negotiate Rs 10,000-20,000 but everything is fixed per case here. It will be done, 100 per cent.”“How do you take the payment?” the reporter asked.“Advance. The total cost for the job now is Rs 230,000. You have to pay 180,000 now and the rest (50,000) later,” he demanded.OMITTING ALCOHOL IN DRUNK DRIVINGadvertisementIn Haryana's Gurugram, Madhup Singh, a senior scientific officer at the FSL, was willing to falsify evidence of alcohol from the samples of a body to help secure insurance claims. 

Madhup SinghHe sought Rs 200,000 for the job.“Such cases come under me. I investigate toxicity and alcohol cases. Give me the details. It will cost at least Rs two (lakh). It’s about giving a clear report in case it’s (alcohol) positive,” he said.“You mean two lakh for converting a positive report into negative?” the reporter asked.“Yes,” Singh replied.Also Read | The importance of being Manish Sisodia--- ENDS ---

Scott Adams, who rose to fame in the 1990s with his satirical take on white-collar office life, has increasingly stoked controversy with his views on social issues. But a video posted on Wednesday -- in which Adams referred to Black people as a ""hate group"" -- proved to be the last straw for many ""Dilbert"" publishers.  ""That's a hate group and I don't want anything to do with them,"" he said.  ""Based on the current way things are going, the best advice I would give to white people is to get the hell away from Black people."" His rant was prompted by a recent poll by conservative-leaning Rasmussen Reports, whose results he said showed a slim majority of Black respondents agreed with the statement ""It's okay to be white."" The USA TODAY Network, which operates hundreds of papers across the United States, said Friday it ""will no longer publish the Dilbert comic due to recent discriminatory comments by its creator."" Chris Quinn, the editor of The Plain Dealer in Cleveland, Ohio, said Friday it ""was not a difficult decision"" for his paper to drop the comic strip. ""We are not a home for those who espouse racism,"" Quinn added.  MLive Media Group -- which runs eight Michigan-based publications -- said it had ""zero tolerance for racism,"" and would drop Adams's strip because of his ""unapologetically racist rant.""  The Washington Post said Saturday it would drop the cartoon from its pages ""in light of Scott Adams's recent statements,"" though it was too late to stop the strip from being published in the weekend's print editions.Don’t miss out on ET Prime stories!

According to police, Amamer Abdul Razak, 32, a resident of Benson Town and general secretary of an educational institution which runs a school near Moodbidri in Dakshina Kannada district, is the victim. Razak told police he planned to construct a school building and in August 2021, the institution decided to raise Rs 10 crore as loan for the same. A person identifying himself as Karthik Muddodi came in contact with Razak during a school function, and the school management discussed the loan requirement with him. Muddodi assured the management of his assistance in getting the loan. Within a few days, he introduced to Razak his friend Mallikarjun, who he claimed knew the MD of a private finance firm located in Thane, Maharashtra. Mallikarjun and Muddodi assured Razak they would get him Rs 10 crore as loan within 45 days if he paid Rs 30 lakh as advance payment to the private firm MD. Razak agreed and transferred Rs 30 lakh to a bank account opened in the name of Neeraj Digambara Chowdary. Mallikarjun and Muddodi arranged an agreement between Razak and the finance firm on August 24, 2021. ""We did not get any loan from the finance company and I asked Mallikarjun and Muddodi about it. Saying that they had forwarded all the documents to the finance company, they sought some time. But they neither got me the loan nor returned my money,"" Razak stated in his complaint. Razak also claimed that Mallikarjun and Muddodi promised to arrange a meeting between him and the MD to take up the issue of loan delay, but no such meeting took place. Bharathinagar police have registered a case of cheating, criminal breach of trust and criminal conspiracy against the gang.

India NewsReported by Vishnu Som, Edited by Divyanshu Dutta RoyUpdated: February 27, 2023 3:36 pm ISTAir India Campbell Wilson took over the airline last June.New Delhi: The full breadth of Air India's turnaround will be felt by the end of next year, chief executive Campbell Wilson has told NDTV in an exclusive interview, also declaring that the flag carrier's new focus will be on long-haul and business fliers in addition to leisure passengers.""We are impatient for change... what many people don't realise is that it takes about 18 months after you commit the money, and decide what product you want to go through the regulatory and engineering and manufacturing process for new seats. As well as installation on new aircraft. So we are going literally as fast as it's possible to go. That's the medium term,"" he said.""Then, clearly, the long term is the new fleet order. These aircraft will come with the latest generation seats and entertainment. So, by the end of 2024, it's quite clear that the vast majority of services that people will experience from us on board the aircraft will be absolutely brand new,"" he said.Air India will start receiving the first of its new build long-range airlines later this year, with six Airbus A-350-900 aircraft. These brand-new aircraft were built for Russian carrier Aeroflot, but could not be delivered because of sanctions placed on Moscow after the Ukraine war.Keen to begin acquiring a new fleet as soon as possible, Air India has decided to acquire these aircraft after making a handful of changes to ensure that the interior of the aircraft reflects the look of Air India.However, the cabins on the A-350-900s will remain essentially unchanged and feature a cutting-edge business class cabin far more refined than anything the airline presently has to offer.It's been confirmed by the @airindiain (AI) CEO that the 6 ex- Aeroflot (SU) #A350-900 will arrive configured in the SU config i.e.,28 Business (J);24 Premium Economy; and264 Economy seats.Going by these photos, AI has a total winner on its hands. Bravo !#AvGeek#PaxExpic.twitter.com/joZTqDDlOz— VT-VLO (@Vinamralongani) February 27, 2023The 52-year-old chief executive, who took over the Tata Group airline in June after the conglomerate bought it back from the Indian government last year, said Air India will now focus on long-haul flights and passengers flying for business.""The untapped potential of Air India, but also Indian aviation, for non-stop services pretty much anywhere in the world is unparalleled. We plan to use the new aircraft we are leasing and purchasing for the long-haul market,"" Mr Wilson told NDTV.""North America is clearly a very attractive market. There's a huge business opportunity, there's a huge diaspora. We have already mounted new services from Delhi, we have restored some services from Mumbai, and Bangalore, and it will continue to be a significant focus,"" he said.""In Europe, we have recommenced services into Copenhagen, Vienna... strengthening London, Heathrow,"" the CEO said.""Hitherto Air India was more of a leisure airline, 0r visiting friends and relatives airline. As India rises in the economic stakes as well as a key node in international business, we will carry more and more business travellers, so the non-stop service into all the key business centres is going to be key,"" Mr Wilson said.""Los Angeles has been constrained by aircraft range. That is not going to be the constraint any more. Other destinations on the West Coast, Midwest. Chicago. Washington DC. New York, we've put a lot of capacity recently. Also let's not forget Canada - Toronto, Vancouver... Australia, New Zealand,"" he said.PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.comThe announcements come after Air India unveiled deals earlier this month for a record 470 jets from Airbus and Boeing, accelerating the revival of its reputation as a world-class airline and shedding its image as a tardy, run-down operation with an ageing fleet and poor service.The provisional deals include 220 planes from Boeing and 250 from Airbus and eclipse previous records for a single airline as Air India vies with domestic giant IndiGo to serve what will soon be the world's largest population.Track Latest News Live on NDTV.com and get news updates from India  and around the world.

The biggest planet in the solar system, Jupiter, and Earth’s mysterious twin are set to form a rare conjunction in the skies across the world on March 1.  advertisementThe planetary meet-up, also known as a conjunction, makes the two planets appear close together or even touch in the Earth's night sky. The planets seem to occupy the same space in the night sky because of their alignment.The two planets are already the brightest in the night sky and can be easily spotted with low light pollution. The two planets formed a trifecta on the evening of February 21 and 22 with the Moon in the skies. At its closest, the two planets will be separated by just 0.5 degrees in the skies. However, they are actually separated by millions of kilometers in the vacuum of space. The two will appear closest due to their position in their orbits around the Sun as seen from Earth. Stargazers across the world will be able to see it with the naked eyes as they will appear to be overlapping each other. The two planets will fit a single frame and in the field of view of cameras and binoculars. ALSO READ | Watch LIVE | SpaceX launches US, Russian, Arab astronauts to spaceAt the start of February, the two planets were separated by 29 degrees, which is going to come down to 2.3 degrees by the end of this month.On March 1 Jupiter is expected to be bright with a magnitude of -2.1, twice as bright as Sirius, the brightest star in the sky. However, it is Venus, which will be brighter at magnitude -4.0. Meanwhile, Venus ranks as the 3rd-brightest natural body in the sky, after the sun and moon. It is so dazzlingly bright that at times it can even be spotted in daylight. The brightness is due to the fact that while it is the closest planet to Earth, it is also covered with highly reflective clouds and the clouds of Venus are good at reflecting sunlight.

		            Dubai housing boom buoys buyers, burdens tenantsSECTIONSDubai housing boom buoys buyers, burdens tenantsAFPLast Updated: Feb 23, 2023, 11:13 AM ISTRate StoryShareFont SizeAbcSmallAbcMediumAbcLargeSavePrintCommentSynopsisDubai, renowned for its towering skyscrapers and ultra-luxury villas, saw record real estate transactions in 2022, largely due to the influx of wealthy investors -- especially from Russia.AgenciesThe real estate sector accounts for about a third of Dubai's economy.With rents soaring and properties selling fast, the expatriate hub of Dubai is in the throes of a housing boom bolstered by rich emigres that has buoyed investors and burdened tenants. Dubai, renowned for its towering skyscrapers and ultra-luxury villas, saw record real estate transactions in 2022, largely due to the influx of wealthy investors -- especially from Russia. That helped to rake in more than $140 billion last year, marking a 76 percent annual rise in property market transactions for the Gulf city state, based on the latest official figures. ""The market in the last year has massively changed -- it is great for landlords, but it's not so good for tenants,"" said Jacob Fletcher of brokerage firm Betterhomes. While it may not be as rich in oil as the UAE capital Abu Dhabi, Dubai lures expatriates with tax incentives, a lush lifestyle and cheap services provided by low-wage labourers from Asia, Africa and the Middle East. In upscale Dubai neighbourhoods, where properties sell for more than $10 million, the 219 sales recorded in 2022 were ""more than the total recorded between 2010 and 2020"", said real estate consultancy Knight Frank. Property prices in these prime locations jumped by 44 percent in 2022 compared with the year before, it said. ""The luxury market in Dubai was the fastest growing in the world but remains cheaper than main big cities,"" said Faisal Durrani, head of Middle East research at Knight Frank.Rich Russians Over a decade ago, Dubai's property market slumped due to a financial crisis. The city is now a magnet for ultra-rich investors, including Russians fleeing the impact of sanctions after their country's invasion of Ukraine. Russians were the biggest foreign buyers on Dubai's property market last year, according to Betterhomes. British, Indian, Italian and French nationals are also among the top investors, the brokerage firm says. Entrepreneurs, business executives, bankers and celebrities are among the wild assortment of clients rushing to clinch a home in one of the first cities to open up after the Covid-19 pandemic. ""We're seeing a lot of customers from Europe, who are wanting to move here and who are wanting to send their kids to school here, start business here,"" said Farhad Azizi, who heads property development firm Azizi Developments. ""So, we were seeing a lot of a lot of new clientele, and they've kept the market very busy."" Most of Dubai's population of more than 3.5 million is comprised of expatriates. But the housing boom has made it more expensive for them to live in the city. ""There's about a 20 percent increase in the rental market this year compared to last year alone,"" said Fletcher of Betterhomes. ""The people that have lived here especially for a while are very not happy with how high the prices have gone.""Take the hitThe real estate sector accounts for about a third of Dubai's economy. The city's residents are used to volatility on the property market, with saw prices plummeting during the 2009 financial crisis as well as the pandemic. With inflation spiralling worldwide, the rapid rise in rental prices in recent months has sparked alarm for many. ""The market is so insane. It's so expensive,"" said a Western expatriate who has lived in Dubai with her husband and son for five years. The family must find a new home because their landlord has decided to sell the apartment. ""The market is very, very different. So, we are going to have to pay for something smaller and further out,"" she told AFP on condition of anonymity. Social media networks are buzzing with disgruntled tenants who are locked in disputes with landlords over rental prices. ""What can we do? We've got to move so we have to take the hit,"" the expatriate said.ET OnlineDon’t miss out on ET Prime stories!

As the sun sets, the 700-odd villagers residing here lock themselves up in their homes and their cattle in safe shelters. However, Bharat Barot walks to his farm, carrying a blanket and a lathi with a machete attached to it, and locks himself inside a cage to guard his wheat and groundnut crops. ""I have been following this practice for six months when a leopard attacked me near my farm. Before this incident, nobody believed me when I told them that I saw a leopard. And now, after I told them that I saw a leopard couple with their cubs near a temple, the villagers are terrified,"" said Bharat, a small farmer. His cage is made of iron rods and pipes. ""I stay in the cage not only to protect my farm, but also to alert the villagers if I see the leopards again,"" said Bharat. Dilip Barot, a resident of Bhatkota, said that a leopard usually attacks small cattle like goats, and pet dogs. ""It could also attack our children. So, while Bharatbhai is keeping a watch on the area to protect our livestock, we too have been following strict lockdown. This animal usually enters the village after sunset and attacks our cattle,"" said Dilip. Bharat, the ex-sarpanch of Bhatkota, says he had made representations to the forest department but no measures were taken to cage the animal. "" I spent Rs 10,000 to get this cage made for myself,"" said Bharat.

India NewsAsian News InternationalUpdated: February 27, 2023 2:49 pm ISTThe plea challened appointment of Rakesh Asthana as Delhi Police Commissioner.New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Monday disposed of the plea challenging appointment of Rakesh Asthana as Delhi's CP observing his term has ended but kept open the issue related to the appointment of DGP.A bench headed by Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud and also comprising Justices PS Narasimha and JB Pardiwala listed the matter for April 3 to examine whether the issue related to the Prakash Singh judgement will have relevance in the Asthana matter or not.Advocate Prashant Bhushan, appearing for the petitioner, submitted that if the Prakash Singh judgement related to the appointment of a senior police official is not dealt with, it will keep coming up again and again.The court was hearing the plea challenging the appointment of Indian Police Service Rakesh Asthana as the Delhi Police Commissioner. The NGO 'Centre for Public Interest Litigation' (CPIL) through its advocate Prashant Bhushan had approached the top court in an appeal against the October 12, 2021 order of the Delhi High Court which had upheld the Centre's decision to appoint Asthana, Gujarat cadre 1984-batch IPS officer, as Delhi Police Commissioner four days before his superannuation on July 31, saying there was ""no irregularity, illegality or infirmity"" in his selection.Delhi High Court had held that the Prakash Singh case will have no relevance in the Asthana case.In the affidavit filed by the Centre, it has maintained that Asthana was picked ""to provide effective policing on the recent law and order situation which arose in the National Capital Territory of Delhi"".The Central government has informed the Supreme Court that there was a ""compelling need"" to appoint Indian Police Service Rakesh Asthana as the Delhi Police Commissioner taking into consideration the national capital's ""extremely challenging situations"" of public order, policing issues, and their implications on national security.The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) while justifying the appointment of Asthana as the Delhi Police commissioner, has informed the top court through an affidavit that Asthana was appointed police chief of Delhi as a ""special case of public interest"".The affidavit was filed on a plea of NGO CPIL against the Delhi High Court order upholding Asthana's appointment as police chief.Asthana had also filed a separate affidavit in the plea saying petitions were filed in the top court following a scathing social media campaign to malign his reputation and that petitioner NGO and Prashant Bhushan harboured a personal vendetta against him.The Delhi High Court while dismissing a PIL challenging Asthana's selection had said the justification and reasons given by the Centre for appointing Asthana are plausible, calling for no interference in judicial review.Asthana, who was serving as the Director-General of the Border Security Force, was appointed the Commissioner on July 27, 2021, after being shifted to the Union Territory cadre from the Gujarat cadre for the tenure of one year.The NGO's petition has urged the top court to set aside the Centre's order to appoint Asthana after extending his service period.PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.comIt had termed the extension of Asthana's tenure as well as an appointment as ""illegal"" as he did not have a residual tenure of mandatory six months of service at the time of his appointment as Commissioner of Police since he was to retire within 4 days.The petition had further claimed that the Centre's order violated the policy regarding the Inter-Cadre deputation of All India Service Officers.Featured Video Of The Day""My Decision To Quit Politics, Nobody Forced Me"": BS Yediyurappa To NDTVAlso ReadMistrust On Medical Services Becoming Narratives: Chief Justice Of India DY ChandrachudChief Justice DY Chandrachud Pitches For Virtual Hearings At Arbitral CentresTwo New Judges Sworn In, Supreme Court Regains Full Strength Of 34Track Latest News Live on NDTV.com and get news updates from India  and around the world.

		            Indian-American entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy announces 2024 presidential bidSECTIONSIndian-American entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy announces 2024 presidential bidBy PTILast Updated: Feb 23, 2023, 05:34 PM ISTRate StoryShareFont SizeAbcSmallAbcMediumAbcLargeSavePrintCommentSynopsisVivek Ramaswamy, 37, whose parents migrated to the United States from Kerala and worked at a General Electric plant in Ohio, made the announcement during a live interview on Fox News's prime time show of Tucker Carlson, a conservative political commentator.Indian-American Vivek Ramaswamy, CEO of 'anti-woke inc', joins US Presidential race for 2024Indian-American tech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy has launched his 2024 presidential bid with a promise to “put merit back” and end dependence on China, becoming the second community member to enter the Republican Party's presidential primary after Nikki Haley.Ramaswamy, 37, whose parents migrated to the United States from Kerala and worked at a General Electric plant in Ohio, announced his presidential bid during a live interview on Fox News's prime time show of Tucker Carlson, a conservative political commentator.He is the second Indian-American to enter the Republican presidential primary.Earlier this month, two-term former governor of South Carolina and former US Ambassador to the United Nations, Haley announced her presidential campaign. She announced that she will contest against her former boss and ex-US President Donald Trump for the Republican Party's nomination.“We are in the middle of this national identity crisis where we have celebrated our differences for so long that we forgot all the ways we are really just the same as Americans bound by a common set of ideals that set this nation into motion 250 years ago,"" Ramaswamy said.He calls “wokeism” a national threat.“Wokeism” is the promotion of liberal progressive ideology and policy as an expression of sensitivity to systemic injustices and prejudices.""That's why I am proud to say tonight that I am running for United States president to revive those ideals in this country,"" he announced.""I think we need to put ‘merit' back into ‘America' in every spirit of our lives,"" he said, adding that he will end affirmative action in ""every sphere of American life.""A second-generation Indian-American, Ramaswamy founded Roivant Sciences in 2014 and led the largest biotech IPOs of 2015 and 2016, eventually culminating in successful clinical trials in multiple disease areas that led to FDA-approved products, according to his bio.He has founded other successful healthcare and technology companies, and in 2022, he launched Strive Asset Management, a new firm focused on restoring the voices of everyday citizens in the American economy by leading companies to focus on excellence over politics.“I'm all for putting America first, but in order to put America first, we have to first rediscover what America is. And to me, those are these basic rules of the road that set this nation into motion from meritocracy to free speech, to self-governance over aristocracy.""The people who we elect actually make them run the government rather than this cancerous federal bureaucracy. That's gonna be the heart of my message,” Ramaswamy told Fox News.He said the US faces external threats like the rise of China.It ""has got to be our top foreign policy threat that we've gotta respond to, not pointless wars somewhere else.""""That's gonna require some sacrifice. It's gonna require a declaration of independence from China and complete decoupling. And that's not gonna be easy. It's gonna require some inconvenience,” he said.Foreign policy is all about prioritisation, Ramaswamy said.“We gotta wake up to the fact that China is violating our sovereignty and the reason, if that had been a Russian spy balloon, we'd have shot it down instantly and ratcheted up sanctions. Why didn't we do that for China?” he asked.“The answer's simple. We depend on them for our modern way of life. This economic co-dependent relationship has to end,” he said.In a statement Democratic National Committee chair Jaime Harrison said as Ramaswamy used Tucker Carlson's show to announce his campaign for president, one thing is clear: The race for the Make America Great Again (MAGA) base is getting messier and more crowded by the day.“Over the next few months, Republicans are guaranteed to take exceedingly extreme positions on everything from banning abortion to cutting Social Security and Medicare and we look forward to continuing to ensure every American knows just how extreme the MAGA agenda is,” Harrison said.Before entering the presidential ballot, Ramaswamy and Haley have to win the Republican Party's presidential primary which will start in January next year. The next US presidential election is scheduled to be held on November 5, 2024.Ramaswamy is the fourth Indian-American to run for the White House.Bobby Jindal ran in 2016 and Vice President Kamala Harris in 2020.Don’t miss out on ET Prime stories!

Over Rs 12 lakh crore in terms of market capitalisation of the Adani scrips has been wiped out, but not all group stocks have fallen in sync. This is where the valuation of individual stocks comes into play. The deep plunge has been possible due to sky-high valuations. The Adani Total Gas stock has crashed nearly 81% since January 24, while Adani Ports has dived 27% in the same period — the fall is in sync with how overvalued they were. Adani Total Gas stock was trading at a multiple of 844 times its earnings on January 24, a number that not even the best disruptive technology company can boast of, while Adani Ports was at 30 times, according to price-to-earnings (PE) ratios sourced from Refinitiv database. Stocks that had relatively lower valuations have fallen less. ACC, which had a PE ratio of 54, has fallen the least (26%) among the 10 Adani Group stocks, followed by Adani Ports (27%) and Ambuja Cements (31%).A company’s PE ratio is one of the indicators of how undervalued or overpriced a scrip is in relation to its profit. Technology and consumer brands, apart from other high-growth companies, usually command steeper valuations than infrastructure or state-owned companies. For instance, TCS has a PE ratio of 31, but Tata Steel has 5. Indraprastha Gas has a PE ratio of 18, while Mahanagar Gas has 13 — both these are in the same business as Adani Total Gas.A stock price indicates the market’s perception. But when there is a meteoric rise in a particular share, as was seen in the case of Adani scrips amid the pandemic, alarm bells start to ring. In May 2021, ET reported that CLSA had dropped coverage on Adani Transmission with the foreign brokerage saying that the stock is driven by speculative interest, keeping valuation at a stratospheric 16 times premium to the sector. That month, Adani Transmission had a PE ratio of 114, which had more than doubled to 351 by January 24 this year. Currently, it is at 73. The May 2021 ET report was quoted by Hindenburg Research in its study.In November 2022, V K Vijayakumar, chief investment strategist at Geojit Financial Services, had alluded to ‘stratospheric’ valuations too. “A major disconnect between profits and market cap can be seen in the case of Adani stocks. Gautam Adani has proven expertise in executing large infrastructure projects, but the stratospheric valuations of Adani stocks are a matter of concern,” he had said in a report. When contacted, a representative of Geojit Financial Services said the firm doesn’t track Adani Group.Interestingly, Adani companies may not be a steal deal even after the selloff. Adani Total Gas, which is stuck in a rut of hitting lower circuits since the report, is still available at 156 times its earnings. “Stock-specific actions will continue in Adani Group,” Kranthi Bathini, director (equity strategy) at WealthMills Securities, said.Hindenburg's predictions about Adani stocks come true?

However, he said, the new look will not be a break from the airline's rich legacy. ""Air India has 90 years of heritage.

And we do need to demonstrate that we are not just rooted in the past, that we are also aspiring towards something in the future,"" he said.In redesigning the airline, views of the Vistara team will also be respected, he said. ""They have built a very good airline over the past eight years. And so I think there's more than 5,000 people there that have an interest in how the new airline is represented. So I think this is really an opportunity to think freshly, while respecting.""Vistara airlines is set for a merger with the Tata-owned Air India by March 2024.Asked if the mustachioed and turbaned Maharajah still will find a place in Air India's grand revamp, Mr Wilson said, ""The Maharajah will certainly be part of our plans in the new look.

Meta, which fired thousands of employees in November last year, is reportedly planning yet another round of layoffs soon. On the other hand, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, who announced 12,000 layoffs recently, had reportedly received a massive pay hike weeks before the decision was announced. The massive salaries of various companies’ CEOs are a much-talked about topic and people often read up these stories with keen interest. However, Cred CEO Kunal Shah is making headlines for completely different reasons.advertisementCred CEO Kunal Shah reveals his salaryThe fintech company’s CEO revealed his salary while replying to a user on Instagram. Shah claims that he only earns Rs 15,000 per month as the company is not yet profitable. The CEO conducted an Ask Me Anything session on Instagram and a user asked him, “Your salary at Cred is so low? How do you survive?”To this, Kunal Shah responded, ""I don't believe I should get a good salary till the company is profitable. My salary at CRED is â‚¹ 15,000 per month and I can survive as I sold my company FreeCharge in the past."" 
While some are heaping praises on the CEO, others are sceptical about the statement.Other tech giants' CEOs’ salary packageMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg reportedly takes home USD 12 billion per year. Recently, reports of the Facebook founder’s security cover being increased had surfaced on the internet. Mark Zuckerberg earlier had a security allowance of USD 10 million. But recent reports suggested that the company will be paying USD 14 million for the same to keep the founder safe.Google CEO Sundar Pichai reportedly earns USD 242 million per year. In December 2022, Google announced that it recognised Sundar Pichai’s excellent performance and that they will be giving an equity reward to the CEO. Alphabet Inc, Google’s parent company, had said at the time that the award had been modified to increase the performance stock units (PSUs) to 60 per cent from the previous 43 per cent in 2019, while increasing the performance requirement for the payout. Thus, more of Pichai’s pay will be tied to the performance of the company.The Google CEO had previously turned down equity compensation in 2018 citing that his pay package was already ‘justified’.Coming to Apple CEO Tim Cook, he was receiving a salary package of USD 99.4 million in 2022. This included a base salary of USD 3 million and around USD 83 million in the form of bonus and stocks. However, in a filing with the SEC, Apple said that Tim Cook’s salary is being revised and the new compensation will be USD 49 million in total going forward. This includes a USD 3 million base salary, along with a 6 million bonus and an equity value of USD 40 million. In addition to this, Cook’s percentage of stock units, tied to Apple’s performance, will also rise to 75 per cent from the previous 50 per cent.--- ENDS ---ALSO READ |  Microsoft increases Bing's daily chat limit to 100 per day, details hereALSO READ |  ChatGPT helps company recover Rs 90 lakh from a client who ghosted them over payment, details hereALSO READ |  Elon Musk now fires 10 per cent Twitter workforce, nearly 200 employees lose their jobs

But the movement is getting pushback from some Hindu Americans who argue that such legislation maligns a specific community.Proponents of the ordinance that was approved by a 6-1 vote Tuesday say caste discrimination crosses national and religious boundaries and that without such laws, those facing caste discrimination in the U.S. will have no protections.The ordinance is a contentious issue, especially among the nation's South Asian diaspora. Supporters argue it is needed because caste is not covered under existing civil rights protections. Groups opposing the measure say it will malign a community that is already the target of prejudice.Council Member Kshama Sawant, a socialist and the only Indian American on the City Council, said the ordinance, which she proposed, does not single out one community, but it accounts for how caste discrimination crosses national and religious boundaries.Activists on different sides of the issue began arriving in Seattle well ahead of Tuesday's city council meeting. As early as last week, more than 100 people had put in requests to speak at the meeting. Early Tuesday, several activists braved cold temperatures and wind gusts to line up outside City Hall so they would get a chance to speak to the council before the vote. But the council restricted public comment at the meeting.The origins of the caste system in India can be traced back 3,000 years as a social hierarchy based on one's occupation and birth. It is a system that has evolved over the centuries under Muslim and British rule. The suffering of those who are at the bottom of the caste pyramid - known as Dalits - has continued. Caste discrimination has been prohibited in India since 1948, a year after the nation's independence from British rule.Dalit activists from Seattle and beyond rallied at Seattle City Hall in support of the ordinance, said Thenmozhi Soundararajan, founder and executive director of California-based Equality Labs.The U.S. is the second most popular destination for Indians living abroad, according to the Migration Policy Institute, which estimates the U.S. diaspora grew from about 206,000 in 1980 to about 2.7 million in 2021. The group South Asian Americans Leading Together reports that nearly 5.4 million South Asians live in the U.S. - up from the 3.5 million counted in the 2010 census. Most trace their roots to Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.Over the past three years, several colleges and university systems have moved to prohibit caste discrimination.In December 2019, Brandeis University near Boston became the first U.S. college to include caste in its nondiscrimination policy. The California State University System, Colby College, Brown University and the University of California, Davis have all adopted similar measures. Harvard University instituted caste protections for student workers in 2021 as part of its contract with its graduate student union.The Seattle measure had the support of Dalit activist-led organizations like Equality Labs and others. The groups say caste discrimination is prevalent in diaspora communities manifesting itself in the form of social alienation and discrimination in housing, education and the tech sector where South Asians hold key roles.Opposition to the ordinance came from groups such as the Hindu American Foundation and the Coalition of Hindus of North America who say it unnecessarily singles-out a community already vulnerable to discrimination in the U.S.Don’t miss out on ET Prime stories!

Waris Punjab De: Who is controversial preacher Amritpal SinghSenior officers TOI spoke to over the past two days said the Central intelligence agencies had flagged Amritpal as a potential threat to calm and peace in Punjab from “day one”, from the time he had landed in India from Dubai in August 2022. barely months after being named by Waris Punjab De as successor to its deceased leader Deep Sidhu. Agencies have thereafter shared regular updates with the Punjab police -- with several such interactions on record -- about Amritpal’s growing following among the radically-inclined Sikhs and his private army of gun-toting supporters that have grown from 4-5 to almost 20-25 now. This ""private army"" is ostensibly to protect him, though it is alleged by many to be a bunch of radical extremists who bully and beat up people and vandalise gurdwaras in the name of upholding Sikh puritanism. A source said while his armed supporters had initially claimed to carry only licensed arms, nobody from the Punjab police has checked these weapons as yet.Radical preacher Amritpal Singh on release of aide Lovepreet ToofanIncidentally, the Punjab police, by not acting against Amritpal Singh despite repeated alerts from the Central intelligence agencies and more recently by bowing to pressure from his supporters to release his aide, have only made his popularity grow, rendering it increasingly difficult to rein him in. Political reasons also have reportedly got the better of security considerations. Some indicated that the Bhagwant Singh Mann government may be avoiding action against Amritpal and would rather have the Central agencies crack down on him first. The home ministry, however, is watching the situation, aware that law and order is the Constitutional domain of the state government. Amritsar: Waris Punjab De’ leader Amritpal Singh visits Golden Temple with aide Lovepreet Singh“Often a meteoric rise is met by an equally rapid fall. Amritpal will make his mistakes, and hopefully, the state government will act against him at least then. At the same time, since larger national security could be at stake, the Centre will do its bit to keep nudging the Punjab government and intervene where necessary and as per the Constitutional scheme of things,” said an MHA functionary.According to intelligence sources, though Shiromani Akali Dal (Amritsar) chief Simranjit Singh Mann had initially backed Amritpal, he is said to have lately stepped back as the Waris Punjab De leader appears to have now acquired the standing of a potential rival. So much so, even Deep Sidhu, who Amritpal got drawn to on social media and later connected with him directly on WhatsApp, is said to have eventually got pestered by him and even blocked him on WhatsApp.As per information gathered by the Central intelligence agencies, Amritpal showed the first signs of radicalisation during Covid period, while reportedly out of business. Even earlier, his social media activity showed him to be a fierce critic of the Modi government; a source said he had even criticised the decision to nullify Article 370 in J&K in 2019.During Covid, he followed stories on Bhindranwale and also social media posts by Sikh radical leaders, including on the Sikh Referendum. Soon he started engaging with radical elements like Deep Sidhu, particularly during the farmers’ protests. This is the time that Pakistan-based ISI elements “spotted” him, said a source. He was subsequently “groomed” to make utterances that would touch a chord with the radically-inclined Sikhs, both in India and abroad. An officer said he has the backing of Avtar Singh Khanda, a UK-based radical leader associated with Khalistan TV, and that the latter used his alleged connections with radical Sikh outfits with foreign-based leadership, who were in turn in touch with ISI, to prop him as a “pro-Khalistan icon”. While Sikh referendum was propagated with ISI’s blessings on social media, targeted killings funded facilitated by Pakistan-based elements and later farmers’ protests helped ISI bring out latent radicalism in Punjab, the idea of having a Burhan-Wani type leader in flesh and blood, styled after Bhindranwale, is an obvious progression in the series of attempts by forces across the border to keep the Khalistan pot boiling, said a senior officer of the security establishment. “Amritpal Singh is bright and brings up issues like freedom of speech that finds resonance with the liberals. He has influenced Sikh youths, many of whom were probably born in the post-militancy period. It is a dangerous trend in a border state where Pakistan can easily send in drones with payloads of arms, IEDs and sticky bombs,” an officer pointed out.

India NewsNDTV News DeskUpdated: February 27, 2023 3:49 pm ISTNew Delhi: Air India CEO Campbell Wilson today admitted that the airlines' could have reacted better to the incident of a drunk flyer urinating on an elderly passenger.""There are things that we didn't do well. We have learnt lessons,"" Air India CEO told NDTV in an exclusive interview.On a New York-Delhi Air India flight on November 26, Shankar Mishra allegedly unzipped his pants and urinated on an elderly woman in the business class. He later begged the woman not to report him to the police, saying it would impact his wife and child.Air India filed a police complaint weeks after the incident and said as there was ""no further flare-up or confrontation"", and ""respecting the perceived wishes of the female passenger, the crew elected not to summon law enforcement upon landing. It banned Mishra from flying for 30 days, triggering outrage by social media users who said it was not enough.Shankar Mishra was arrested by the Delhi Police on Friday, six weeks after the incident.Mr Wilson told NDTV that the airlines has realised the importance of reporting incidents.""One of the key things is reporting incidents that happen. Perhaps there was a culture before where things we tried to resolve internally rather than reporting. Perhaps,"" Mr Wilson said.Elaborating on the steps that the airlines has taken after the November incident, Mr Wilson said that they have reviewed their alcohol policy and also briefed their staff about how to deal with drunk passengers.He also added that Air India is now investing more in technology. He said that in most cases, the airlines crew is at the receiving end when a drunk passenger misbehaves.PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com""In the vast majority of cases, the people that suffer the abuse, be verbal, sometimes physical, are our crew.

The city accounted for 72% of all such money lost across Karnataka.A statewide analysis shows that people in Karnataka lost more than Rs 722 crore in the same period (January 2019 to January 2023), at a rate of more than Rs 48 lakh a day. Data from the home department shows the money people lost has increased each year at both the state level and in the city.Amount recovered from cybercrooks remains low  From Rs 71.2 crore in the state and Rs 47.6 crore in Bengaluru in 2019, the amount jumped by 49% and 66%, respectively, in 2020. From there, the state saw a 37% jump in 2021, while it was 24% in Bengaluru.The numbers further jumped in 2022 too when more than Rs 363 crore, including Rs 266.7 crore in Bengaluru, was lost. In 2023, people of Karnataka on average lost at least Rs 1 crore a day with more than Rs 36 crore having been stolen by cybercriminals, while the same stood at more than Rs 84 lakh in Bengaluru. The amount of money authorities have managed to recover from cybercrooks remains low - only Rs 97.3 crore out of the Rs 722 crore. Of the Rs 97.3 crore, Rs 63 crore was recovered from incidents in Bengaluru. While this information was made available by home minister Araga Jnanendra in response to a specific question from legislator M Nagaraju, he also gave information in reply to a separate question by legislator Chandrashekar B Patil. As part of the second reply, Jnanendra said: ""Cases are being booked under IPC and IT Act. As part of preventive measures, we are creating a specialised cyberpolice station in each district, besides having directed every police station to accept complaints about cybercrime.""As per his second reply, between January 2020 and January 2023, at least 32,746 cybercrimes have been recorded in the state involving over 11,125 accused.

The sooner members of the legislature decide to have him replaced, the better it shall be for the state,"" said the Ramgarh MLA, who is also the son of state RJD president Jagadanad Singh.Mr Singh, who had started his political journey a decade ago with the BJP, also mocked Mr Kumar's alleged prime ministerial ambitions, asserting that ""it would be better to impose President's rule in the country instead of having Nitish Kumar as the PM"".Replying to a query, he said, ""My vote will always be for (Deputy Chief Minister) Tejashwi Yadav, though I leave it to members of the party to decide who shall succeed Mr Kumar.""When pointed out that his words could lead to a backlash from the JD(U), Mr Singh claimed the party is ""full of opportunists flocking together for the sake of power"".PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.comMr Singh was slapped with a show-cause notice by the RJD last month, following his remarks against the Chief Minister.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)Featured Video Of The DayIt's Ranbir Kapoor's Makkar Eleven Vs  Sourav Ganguly's Jhooti ElevenTrack Latest News Live on NDTV.com and get news updates from India  and around the world.

The Bharat Jodo Yatra led by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi resumed Sunday from Hiranagar in Jammu and Kashmir's Kathua district amid heightened security in the wake of twin blasts in Jammu. After a day-long break, the foot march started as per schedule around 7 am from Hiranagar near the International Border along the Jammu-Pathankot highway which was sealed by police and other security forces.  Accompanied by J-K Pradesh Congress chief Vikar Rasool Wani, working president Raman Bhalla and hundreds of volunteers carrying the tricolour, Gandhi entered Samba district's Tapyal-Gagwal after crossing Londi check point at around 8 am and was greeted by enthusiastic workers and supporters waiting on both sides of the road. After covering about 25-km distance, the march will have a night halt at Chak Nanak before restarting from Samba's Vijaypur for Jammu, where it will reach on Monday. Officials said adequate security arrangements are in place for Gandhi with police, CRPF and other security agencies keeping a tight vigil to ensure a peaceful march. Security has been further beefed up across Jammu and Kashmir in the wake of twin bomb blasts in Narwal area on the outskirts of Jammu city on Saturday, that left nine people injured.  Police suspect that IEDs were used to carry out the twin explosions in an SUV parked in a repair shop and in a vehicle at a nearby junkyard at Transport Nagar area of Narwal. The terror attack comes at a time when security agencies in the region are on high alert in the wake of the Yatra of the Congress and the upcoming Republic Day celebrations.

A few days later, the rear-end design of the upcoming sedan was leaked on the internet. Now, the 2023 Verna has been snapped in flesh for the first time, revealing the complete exterior styling of the car!Talking about the design of the new-gen Verna, it features a split-headlamp setup at the front, with a large radiator grille dominating the face, flanked by the main headlight unit. A full-width LED DRL strip divides the bonnet and t he front bumper, while the Hyundai emblem is placed on the former. Moving to the sides, the new Verna has some strong character lines, especially on the rear doors. The sedan has a sloping roofline with a shark fin antenna, and sits on diamond-cut alloy wheels. Talking about the rear design, the inverted L-shaped tail lights are conjoined with an LED light bar. The rear bumper features dual-tone treatment. In other markets, the Verna is sold as 'Accent', and hence, the name can be seen placed right above the LED light bar on the boot lid. However, the India-spec model will feature the 'Verna' badging instead.Hyundai Ioniq 5 test drive review: Beyond brilliance! | TOI AutoThe 2023 Verna will be available with two petrol engines, including the current 1.5-litre NA petrol motor that puts out 115 PS and 144 Nm, as well as a brand-new 1.5-litre turbo petrol engine which could put out around 160 PS of maximum power and 253 Nm of peak torque. The new turbocharged petrol engine will replace the 1.0-litre three-cylinder mill (120 PS/172 Nm) that is currently on offer. The new-gen Verna will not be offered with a diesel engine.The new engine will also make it the most powerful sedan in its segment. That said, the new 1.5-litre turbo petrol motor will also likely be carried over to the Creta, Kia Seltos and Carens in near future. Transmission options will include a 6-speed MT, as well as an optional 7-speed DCT.Read Also5 reasons why upcoming new Hyundai Verna could become best-selling mid-size sedan in IndiaHere is a list of top 5 reasons why we believe that the upcoming new Hyundai Verna could go on to become the top-selling mid-size sedan.The upcoming new Hyundai Verna is expected to come equipped with Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) like Autonomous Emergency Braking, Adaptive Cruise Control, Lane-Keep Assist and more. Other features on offer will likely include an electric sunroof, a large infotainment screen with connected-car tech, a digital driver's display, powered driver's seat, ventilated front seats and so on.Do you like how the 2023 Hyundai Verna looks in flesh?

		            Will win from Kolar even if PM and Amit Shah campaigned against me: SiddaramaiahSECTIONSWill win from Kolar even if PM and Amit Shah campaigned against me: SiddaramaiahPTILast Updated: Jan 21, 2023, 02:24 PM ISTRate StoryShareFont SizeAbcSmallAbcMediumAbcLargeSavePrintCommentSynopsis​​The former Chief Minister has decided to shift his constituency from Badami in Bagalkote district in North Karnataka to Kolar citing age factor and the distance. Congress leader Siddaramaiah (File Pic)Senior Congress leader Siddaramaiah, who has decided to contest the upcoming assembly election in Karnataka from Kolar segment, asserted on Saturday that he will surely win even if Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah were to campaign against him. The former Chief Minister has decided to shift his constituency from Badami in Bagalkote district in North Karnataka to Kolar citing age factor and the distance. ""Let (BJP national general secretary) B L Santhosh come, BJP national president J P Nadda, Prime Minister Narendra Modi or Union Home Minister Amit Shah and campaign against me. I will surely win from Kolar,"" he told reporters. Siddaramaiah was reacting to a query that a negative campaign has begun ever since he expressed his desire to contest from Kolar in the assembly poll, which is just four months away. There were reports that handbills are being distributed in the district against Siddaramaiah. The Congress veteran added that the same was tried in Badami from where he contested in the 2018 assembly election and he won despite the campaign by Amit Shah and other senior BJP leaders. Siddaramaiah had contested the 2018 assembly election from two assembly seats - Chamundeshwari and Badami. While he lost the Chamundeshwari seat with a huge victory margin of over 36,000 votes against the JD(S) candidate G T Deve Gowda, Badami was his face saver though he won with a narrow victory margin of about 1,700 votes against BJP's B Sriramulu. The former CM clarified that he was not contesting from Badami because it was too far away and age was a factor keeping him from contest the elections there. ""People of Badami want me there and are ready to even sponsor a helicopter but due to age related issues and distance, I have decided to fight election from Kolar,"" he said. Asked about the PM lauding the Karnataka government, he said Modi was lying. ""Is it not a fact that people made money in the police sub-inspector recruitment scam? Why is the additional director general of police Amrit Paul in jail?"" Siddaramaiah asked. He also alleged that the 'notorious criminal Santro Ravi' was being protected by the government. ""Santro Ravi is being protected. He is a notorious criminal, who is charged with rape. He was into transfer business and Protection of Children against Sexual Offences (POCSO). Why he was not taken yet on police custody?"" Siddaramaiah said. The Congress stalwart exuded confidence that his party will come to power with absolute majority by winning 140 to 150 seats in the next assembly election. He pinned hopes on the Congress' promise of 200 unit free electricity to every household and Rs 2,000 per month to women who head the family.Don’t miss out on ET Prime stories!

Accordingly, he was released after the completion of bail formalities,"" he said.AgenciesScholar-activist Anand Teltumbde, an accused in the Elgar Parishad-Maoist links case, was on Saturday released from the Taloja central prison in Navi Mumbai, a day after the Supreme Court rejected the National Investigation Agency's (NIA) plea challenging the bail granted to him, an official said. Teltumbde, 73, who spent two-and-a-half years behind bars in the case, walked out of the jail around 1.15 pm, he said. ""On Friday, the apex court had dismissed the NIA's plea challenging the Bombay High Court's order giving bail to Teltumbde. Accordingly, he was released after the completion of bail formalities,"" he said. On November 18, the high court had granted bail to Teltumbde, who was arrested by the central agency on April 14, 2020, after he surrendered before the NIA, the official said. Teltumbde is the third of the 16 accused arrested in the case to be released on bail. Poet Varavara Rao is currently out on bail on health grounds while lawyer Sudha Bharadwaj is out on regular bail. The case relates to alleged inflammatory speeches made at the Elgar Parishad conclave held in Pune on December 31, 2017, which the police claimed triggered violence the next day near the Koregaon-Bhima war memorial on the outskirts of the western Maharashtra city. Pune Police had also claimed that the conclave was organised by some persons with alleged Maoist links. A First Information Report was lodged by Pune Police on January 8, 2018, under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). The NIA later took over the case. Teltumbde had claimed he was not present at the December 31, 2017 Elgar Parishad event held in Pune city, nor made any provocative speeches.Don’t miss out on ET Prime stories!

There is some grass apparent through the middle, and on this sweltering Sunday afternoon, unexpected heat for this time of year, there is generous watering too. The surface is being preened and polished for the big occasion, the third Test between India and Australia starting from Wednesday. There is a veritable army of ground staff fussing and fretting over their latest creation. The pitch, after all, is a vital cog in India’s Test machinations at home. Read AlsoCan KL Rahul’s Test career survive this latest lean patch?The decision to strip Rahul of vice-captaincy duties for the third Test clearly indicates that the 30-year-old is treading thin ice. The fact that Shubman Gill has been in red-hot form leading up to the Australia series and has been still made to wait has added to the clamour for Rahul’s head.Just a few feet away, India coach Rahul Dravid adopts a no-interference policy. Instead his eyes are focused on the struggling KL Rahul, who has decided to have an extensive nets session. Eventually it is Suryakumar Yadav who saunters up for a brief chat with the ‘pitch people’. In between, a ‘bounce’ test is also carried out with a red ball, though the attempt is abandoned midway.To any watching Australian eyes, this is all hoodoo, intended to conjure up instant fear. It is becoming increasingly exasperating for visiting batsmen to read these pitches, the varying properties of the soil from one venue to another, the extent of turn and wear. This leads to the kind of crippling doubt and injudicious strokeplay that has blighted Australia’s campaign so far in this series.Even when these supposedly undercooked pitches have failed to serve up the expected diet of poisonous turn and toxic natural variation, they have controlled the narrative, sometimes even undermining the efforts of India’s excellent attack. Visiting teams often tend to deride India’s sublime bowling performances on these so-called ‘doctored’ wickets, but for reference, just see the turn of events in the previous Test of this series at the Ferozeshah Kotla, where Australia imploded from a position of strength on the third morning. They played the pitch and not so much India’s bowlers. Such surfaces have been the focal point, along with the precise, penetrative and relentless attack, of India’s complete domination and mastery of spin-friendly home conditions now stretching back a decade. The mastery of the bowlers has meant the top order has often had to sacrifice its hunger for big, easy home runs in the quest for victory. Leading 2-0 in this fourgame series heading into Indore, India have won 15 consecutive home series in a streak stretching back to February 2013. Just how good have India been? Read AlsoRavi Shastri backs Shubman Gill for last two Australia Tests, not in favour of a vice-captain for India in home seriesRavi Shastri is backing Shubman Gill to partner skipper Rohit Sharma as opener in place of KL Rahul in the last two Tests of the four-match Border-Gavaskar trophy between India and Australia, which the hosts lead 2-0.The great Australian teams of the 90s won 10 series in succession between Nov 1994 to Jan 2001, and again 10 in succession the following decade between July 2004 and December 2008. Among the top three teams at home since the start of 2018, India have an 88.89 win percentage, compared to Australia’s 69.23% and New Zealand’s 68.42%. Since the start of 2013, India have won 81.82% of their home games, or 36 out of 44 played. They have lost just two. These are some serious numbers and it can be argued that at least at home, India have been one of Test cricket’s greatest teams over the past decade. In 2019, India became the first team in Test history to notch up 4 successive wins by an innings. Of the 16 (out of 18) Tests India have won at home since 2018, they have won 2 inside 2 days, 9 inside 3 days, 4 in 4 days and only 1 in the full 5 days.Does this mean Steve Smith and Co. cannot win in Indore, or even stretch the game the distance? Certainly not. After all, they did have their moments in Delhi. However, they are up against a formidable attack which knows how to intelligently exploit home conditions. It is quite a challenge the Aussies must now embrace.

Former Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray last week said his party has immense respect for Savarkar and they do not approve of Gandhi's remarks about the late Hindutva ideologue.AgenciesSanjay Raut and Rahul GandhiShiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray) leader Sanjay Raut on Monday said he received a call from Congress MP Rahul Gandhi who enquired about his health, and claimed such gestures were becoming rare in times of ""political bitterness"". Raut said Gandhi's Bharat Jodo Yatra, a mass contact initiative underway from September 7, is getting a massive response because he is ""focussing on love and compassion"". The Rajya Sabha member's praise for Gandhi comes at the time when the latter has been facing flak for his remarks on freedom fighter V D Savarkar. Former Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray last week said his party has immense respect for Savarkar and they do not approve of Gandhi's remarks about the late Hindutva ideologue. Gandhi recently called Savarkar a symbol of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). He had also claimed that Savarkar helped the British rulers and wrote a mercy petition to them out of fear. Raut, who was recently granted bail in a money laundering case, in a tweet on Monday said, ""In spite of strong differences of opinion on some issues, inquiring on your political colleague is a sign of humanity! During his busy schedule of Bharat Jodo Yatra, Rahul Gandhiji called yest'day to inquire abt my health. 'We were worried for you' he said (sic)."" ""I appreciate his empathy of feeling the pain of a political colleague who spent 110 days in jail. In d times of political bitterness, such gestures are becoming rare. Rahulji is focusing on love & compassion in his yatra and hence it is getting massive response,"" he added. Raut was released from Mumbai's Arthur Road Jail earlier this month after a court granted him bail in a money laundering case.Don’t miss out on ET Prime stories!

		            Traders bet on calendar spread as Nifty moves in a tight rangeSECTIONSTraders bet on calendar spread as Nifty moves in a tight rangeBy Nishanth Vasudevan, ET BureauLast Updated: Aug 13, 2010, 02:25 AM ISTRate StoryShareFont SizeAbcSmallAbcMediumAbcLargeSavePrintCommentSynopsisA trading combination involving Nifty options is gaining prominence among savvy trading desks of institutional investors.

MUMBAI: A trading combination involving Nifty options is gaining prominence among savvy trading desks of institutional investors. The strategy, known as calendar spread, where traders simultaneously sell options contracts in the current month and purchase in the next month, is being recommended by brokers to institutional clients, who see sharp moves in Nifty options’ implied volatility — a key component of options pricing — in September.“There is scope for money to be made by selling current month vols (implied volatility) and buying September vols,” said Girish Patil, manager-derivatives, Antique Stockbroking. In this spread strategy, traders use the premium they receive by selling the current series to part-finance the cost of buying options in the next month. “With only a few more days for the August series expiry, vols are unlikely to jump in this series,” Patil said.Futures and options contracts for the August series will expire on 26th while the September series will expire on 30th next month. Options sellers, who pocket the premium from the buyer, prefer fewer trading days in a trading month because of time value — another key aspect of options pricing. Time value of options decays closer to expiry of contracts, resulting in limited movements in options prices. Selling Nifty 5500 calls options in the August series and buying the same contract in the September series is a good strategy in this kind of a market, said Shailesh Kadam, AVP-derivatives, PINC Research.“This strategy bets that the Nifty will be range-bound and will not move above 5500 in the August series, while the undertone is positive next month,” Kadam said.In the past one month, the Nifty has largely moved in a tight band between 5350 and 5450, resulting in the volatility index — a measure of traders’ expectations of near-term risks in the market — moving in the 15-20% band, the lowest range since January 2008. This indicates traders are comfortable about the market levels in the near-term.Brokers said that options traders have struggled to make money, of late, in the absence of sharp index movements. “Vol buyers (buyers of options) have lost their money, while sellers don’t have the courage to sell vols at such low levels,” said the head of derivatives at an institutional broking house. “So, unless there is a sharp move, calendar spread appears to be the best strategy,” he said.Don’t miss out on ET Prime stories!

		            Nifty may find support at 5300 levelSECTIONSNifty may find support at 5300 levelBy Bhavin Desai, Last Updated: Aug 12, 2010, 02:22 AM ISTRate StoryShareFont SizeAbcSmallAbcMediumAbcLargeSavePrintCommentSynopsisAs far as stock futures are concerned, we are very near to the highest-ever open interest with 195 crore shares in open interest. The Nifty started Wednesday’s trade on a rather timid note. As the underlying index was quietly drifting downwards, the futures started trading at a deeper discount of nearly 10 points.It was the last hour of trade that saw better volumes and a sharp movement. The fall amid global uncertainties has brought the Nifty once again to the level of 5400. Even the participation seems to be a little scared, as Nifty futures ended the day’s trade with an addition of over a million shares in open interest indicating creation of hedges.As far as stock futures are concerned, we are very near to the highest-ever open interest with 195 crore shares in open interest. With nearly 70% of the stocks still trading with a premium, the bias among participants seems to be upwards. This would create a bit of pressure on the market in case of any macro uncertainty.As we are almost half way through to expiry, it makes sense to continue with long positions, but along with long puts simultaneously so that losses are capped, still keeping all the upside open.On the options side, Nifty August series open interest put-call ratio is at 1:58, indicating a moderately bullish composition. Even the implied volatilities element of the options which indicate the assumption of the risk remains very low. This indicates we may not see a huge downside as far as the August expiry is concerned. With over 10 million shares in 5300 August Put, the Nifty may find support around the level of 5300. We feel one can do a Nifty bear ratio spread to hedge trading longs, by buying 1 lot Nifty August 5400 PE & selling 2 lots of Nifty August 5300 PE.This strategy accrues profit within the 5200 & 5400 range in case the Nifty ends up in this range on expiry. On the event the Nifty heads upwards to close above 5400, one can still have a cash inflow and no cost of hedging. The strategy does incur loss below 5200, which we feel shall hold good for the August expiry.(Bhavin Desai is Manager (derivatives), Motilal Oswal Securities )Don’t miss out on ET Prime stories!

		            Seven out of top 10 Asian small-cap funds are IndianSECTIONSSeven out of top 10 Asian small-cap funds are IndianBy Shailendra Bhatnagar, Last Updated: Aug 12, 2010, 10:50 AM ISTRate StoryShareFont SizeAbcSmallAbcMediumAbcLargeSavePrintCommentSynopsisAn analysis of 300 Asian small-cap schemes shows DSP BlackRock Micro Cap Fund leading the charge, delivering an 82% return over the past year.Indian funds have grabbed seven out of the top 10 spots in the league table of leading small-cap funds across Asia, thanks to some canny stock-picking amid growing investor appetite for cheap stocks with potential to deliver multi-bagger returns.An analysis of nearly 300 Asian small-cap schemes shows DSP BlackRock Micro Cap Fund leading the charge, delivering an 82% return over the past year. Managed by Vinit Sambre, who has been with DSP BlackRock for a little over three years, this fund has also soundly beaten the 58% rise of BSE’s Small-Cap Index since August 2009. The 30-share benchmark Sensex has gained 20% during this period while the wider BSE 500 Index is up 27%.The other six schemes — Sundaram BNP Paribas Select Small Cap, HSBC Small Cap, JPMorgan Smaller Companies, Franklin India Prima, Franklin India Smaller Companies and ING Vysya CUB — have given investors returns between 44% and 57% on a trailing 12-month basis. These schemes manage anywhere between `46 crore and `954 crore.Four of these funds were launched during the peak of the previous bull run between January 2007 and March 2008, and investors in them have also had to endure a massive erosion in their initial investment in the downturn that followed.Mutual fund tracking firm Value Research called the DSP fund as an impressive product in the entire “small-cap universe”, noting that the stocks held by it were “credible, known names and there is a marked absence of momentum in the portfolio”. The fund’s holding includes companies with a high return on equity and strong leadership niches in their industries.Value Research CEO Dhirendra Kumar said the closed-ended nature of some of these funds helped them weather the market turbulence. “These funds did not face redemption pressures through the declining phase. This, in turn helped them invest for the longer term,” he said.The DSP fund became open-ended in June this year and fund manager Mr Sambre has kept nearly 10% of his `311-crore corpus in cash to meet potential redemptions and to latch onto any opportunity in the market.There are 10 small-cap funds in India, which manage roughly `3,450 crore in stocks. These account for just 2% of the total AUM under equity schemes.Market experts say that as many large-cap stocks became fully priced and relatively unattractive over the past year, the rally shifted to small caps. Stocks such as cooler maker Symphony and luggage maker VIP Industries have led the small-cap charge in the market. Ahmedabad-based Symphony has surged 830% while VIP has risen 548% in the past 12 months. In comparison, top two gainers on the Sensex — Tata Motors and Tata Consultancy Services — are up 135% and 61%, respectively.“Many small caps with excellent businesses were trading at a pathetically low valuations — many were trading below book value and at dividend yields of 5-7%,” says Deven Choksey, chief executive officer at KR Choksey Shares & Securities. “They just got purchased heavily.”Even though small-cap funds have delivered solid returns in the past one year, experts say that investors must be cautious and have just 10-15% of their equity exposure in such funds or companies. This is largely because of the volatile nature of their stock performance.“Investors should have a strong stomach and the ability to withstand substantial declines in such funds,” says Mr Kumar at Value Research.Don’t miss out on ET Prime stories!

		            Inflation reflects growth dynamics in India: Christopher WoodSECTIONSInflation reflects growth dynamics in India: Christopher WoodLast Updated: Aug 08, 2010, 07:32 PM ISTRate StoryShareFont SizeAbcSmallAbcMediumAbcLargeSavePrintCommentSynopsisIndia has inflation and it reflects the fundamental growth, Christopher Wood, equity strategist, CLSA, said at ET Now Mkt Summit-2010.
Key note address delivered by Christopher Wood, equity strategist, CLSA, in his first public appearance in India, at the ET Now Market Summit-2010. Excerpts:Hello everybody and thank you for asking me. I will be running through some charts which were still first with the situation in the West. Then I will move on to charts on Asia and India. So I get the bad news out of way first. But this seems to be the wrong way around. So I am getting from back to front here. (Watch)To start with the US situation, this is a big picture chart everybody needs to be aware of in the global economy. This is US total debt as a percentage of GDP. The story is very simple and the total amount of debt in the system in the US has been going down ever since the credit crisis erupted in 2007-2008. This the first time total debt has been falling in America since the Great Depression.Mr Bernanke of the Federal Reserve has been trying to get the re-leveraging game going so far, they have not succeeded. My operating assumption is to assume that the leveraging will continue that we peaked out in the US super credit cycle in 2007, which has been running since the Second World War and now in a long-term de-leveraging cycle, which means lower trend GDP growth. May be re-leveraging will kick in coming months in which case I will change my view, but for now I am assuming it's a de-leveraging cycle until the data proves otherwise. Next chart you see US total net credit market borrowings and you can see the rate of growth of borrowing has been going down in the system despite the big kick up in Federal Government borrowing.Next chart is a long-term trend in US nominal GDP 10-year compound annual growth. As the Japanese example has shown in the last 20 years, when you get into a deflationary environment, it no longer makes sense to look at real GDP measures because when inflation zero level what gives a more realistic picture of what is going is nominal GDP. And in my view, nominal GDP growth in America will continue to trend down. We have seen a big rally in US government bond prices this year, as telling you the trend nominal GDP growth is lower and that means the trend earnings growth, trend revenue growth in America is also going to be lower.Then next chart relates to the consumption story in America which in my view is going to remain anaemic. In my view the US consumers, western consumers in general, are going to be increasing savings rate. There is also a demographic kicking in... the baby boom as heading for retirement, but they cannot afford to retire. So topline is US real disposable personal income, the bottom line is real personal income excluding current transfer receipts. Transfer receipts basically mean welfare payments. So you can see without all the stimulus from the government the fundamental income trend is much weaker. What separates the emerging markets from the developed world is an emerging markets like India with healthy income growth and the developed countries, be it the US, Japan, Europe, we do not have healthy income growth.Next chart highlights a significant rally in US Treasury Bond prices reflected in declining treasury bond yields which has happened this year. At the start of this year the biggest bearish consensus amongst global equity investors was that US Treasury bonds were screaming sells. Everybody said that the treasury bond market is going to collapse, the Fed printing money inflation is coming back. Clearly that consensus was completely wrong. US Treasury Bond market has been rallying even with the recent pick in the S&P and recent weeks up to 1150 level which I think was a peak of this counter trend rally. Even with the stock market rally the bond market did not sell off. What this bond market is telling you is that nominal GDP growth is slowing in America, it is telling you it is not a normal recovery. The credit multiplier is not working.Once the inventory cycles happen & the US capex cycle has ran through, there will be nothing left to sustain the economic momentum. So in a deflationary environment, government bond prices are lead indicator of nominal GDP growth. Right now this is a very important point because the US bond market is sending one message and the US stock market is sending another message and basically investors have a decision to make - do they believe the bond market is giving the correct signal or the stock market? My assumption is that it’s the bond market and my experience is that the bond market is no way smarter than the stock market 90% of the time. Meanwhile, this is US headline CPI inflation for the rest of this year we are going to see inflationary pressures falling throughout the world in the West. That’s going to lead to new deflation concerns.In Asia and countries like China and India, falling inflationary pressures are going to be bullish and everybody is going to realise it does not make sense to worry about inflation in countries like India. The good news is that you have inflation because that reflects the fundamental growth dynamic. But the key point about the US is if the trend over the past 3 months has extrapolated forward, US CPI inflation will turn negative in October. If that happens, it’s not going to be bullish for equities, it’s going to be bullish for government bonds and it’s going to be a signal for Mr. Bernanke, if we have not done that already, to assume quantitative easing.Next chart, US average duration of unemployment. So basically there are large groups of the structurally unemployed in America. So in this sense, the US is heading for the European systems situation were you have a large group of structurally unemployed living off the welfare state. The problem in America is that the welfare state is much more controversial than in Europe, hence the political divide in America, hence the growing trend under the so-called Tea Party movement. Meanwhile the classic monetary measures are highlighting the fact that we are not in a re-leveraging cycle, we are still in a deleveraging cycle. This is the US money multiplier representing the velocity of money in circulation. Velocity of money in circulation is declining. So long as that line is declining, it’s deflationary. We don’t have to worry about inflation picking up, and this chart highlights the growing deflationary threat.Next chart is US broad money supply growth. Again, money supply growth is going down. That’s why the bond market’s rallying, that’s why inflation is not an issue, that’s why Mr. Bernanke is now looking for an excuse to resume quantitative easing.Next chart is US bank lending. Again, no real sign of any kind of meaningful pick up in bank lending annualise lending loan growth continue to slow another indication of a deleveraging cycle. This is not just about banks restricting credit, it is also about a change in psychology, economic agents be it the companies or consumers have become more risk averse about borrowing.Next chart is US total securitisation issuance. In the recent credit boom before the bust a large part of the credit cycle was driven by securitization, therefore we are going to get re-leveraging in America. We need to see a healthy pick up in securitisation as well as banking lending, but the only area that has picked up since the crisis is the dark blue line here. This is agency mortgage bank securities, that’s Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These entities are guaranteed by the Federal Government and therefore they do not really count. Any private sector securitisation has barely recovered. Meanwhile the huge role played by Fannie and Freddie should not be ignored in terms of supporting the housing market.Basically about 96% of the America mortgage market now is government guaranteed. So that's the US situation. The big picture is still deflationary. However, in terms of macroeconomic shocks that could cause another steep fall in global equities this year for the rest of 2010, I still believe there is going to be another sharp decline in equities like we saw in April and May. It’s more likely to be triggered by the Eurozone where you have systemic risk relating to government debt. So this chart relates to the ECBs net buying of Euroland government bonds. The key point here is this ECB was forced reluctantly to stop buying junk government bonds in Europe like Greek government bonds in May when the Greek crisis blew up. The interesting point is the ECB is only doing this reluctantly and as equity markets have rallied and the credit spreads have come in, the ECB has progressively bought less and less junk government paper.Basically last week they hardly bought anything – they’re probably going to go down to zero just as this counter trend rally peaks.How early we go down depends on whether there is another bout of risk aversion or markets are just focusing on waning growth. This is Greek and PIG government bond yield spreads. I was recommending for several years the investor should bet on wise widening PIG spread. PIG spread, for people who don’t know this, is the average bond yield of Portugal, Ireland, Greece, Spain over the German bond yields-I closed out that just about when the Greek crisis peaked. And I think a better trade is going forward is what I called a Spanish flu trade, betting on rising Spanish CDS.For now the jury doubts on whether these European countries can make the fiscal adjustments being demanded by the Germans, but people should understand that the Germans have a completely diametrically opposite view to the Americans - they simply do not believe that fiscally stimulating is the way to get yourself out of the economic problem. So right now the weaker part of Euroland has embarked on a fiscal adjustments which is intrinsically deflationary, given the downturn they are facing.The stress test is being led by Ireland. Last year the Irish economy contracted in nominal terms by more than 10 percentage points. So far the Irish are taking the pain probably because the only boom they have had in the last 1000 years was when they join Euroland community. So in that sense willing to take quite a lot of pain, but in the big stress test it is going to be Spain.Spain is a big important country. They had a massive private sector debt binge, they got the biggest housing bust in the west, even bigger than the US. So it is going to be interesting to see whether the Spanish political system can make this fiscal adjustment, given the fact they already have nearly 20% unemployed. I have an open mind on this. We just have to see what happens and may be the Europeans can make this fiscal adjustment, in which case it’s going to be a lot of pain, but the Euro as a currency is going to merge with huge credibility. On the other hand, it may well be that this level of fiscal austerity is simply incompatible with the political systems of these Mediterranean countries. Right now, it is impossible to tell the European who is watching the football and now at the beach we can have a much better ideas they can take this pain by about January-February next year.But in the meantime if the markets will test or are bound to test the European’s willingness to take this fiscal adjustment in the next few months. Tactically I would be selling the Euro against the dollar here as we had a significant bounce back in the Euro. So those are my thoughts on basically the West. It’s a deflationary environment. But in the US we are going to continue to stimulate in the Europeans because the Europe’s case is going to follow the German President.Turning to Asia, Asia is a fundamentally healthy story unlike the West. In my view, the peak of the Asia ex-Japan index you saw prior to the credit crisis will be exceeded sooner or later because the Asian economies are growing healthily and have effectively decoupled from the West even though the markets haven’t. This is MSCI Asia ex-Japan relative to MSCI world index. They’ve been in & outperforming trend since the bottom of the Asian crisis in 1998 and that outperforming trend is resuming when the Chinese stock tightening and then formally start easing again which will happen in the next few months. That will reaccelerate Asian outperformance.Valuation wise, Asia is trading in line with the US on the 12-month forward PE basis. In my view, sooner or later Asia is going to trade at a sustainable premium over the West because the fundamental growth story is so superior. In terms of my relative return asset allocation, I’m going to take a detour here. I am structurally overweight on India and Indonesia as these are the two best long-term stories in Asia. But tactically I have reduced India a bit and raised China because we are going to get a policy inflection points in China in the next few months which will be bullish for Chinese stocks.But my big underweight in Asia Pac portfolio is Australia which is why I’m weaving more money into China because it has become cheap. What I am underweight on is those stock, sectors, countries which are perceived as beneficiaries of Chinese growth like the commodities sector, because in my view, Chinese growth is going to be slowing for the rest of this year and that’s a negative headwind for the commodities complex.From an Indian standpoint that was obviously positive. I think oil is going this week to be as high as it’s going to get on its counter trend move. Clearly if you are more bullish on oil, you will be more bearish on India and this is my long only portfolio on Asia or ex-Japan.I started this portfolio beginning of fourth quarter 2002, sent about 25 to 30 stocks in it, mostly large cap. I cannot have any cash and it’s long only and is basically playing the domestic story in Asia as always. Mostly has the biggest weight being in India because India since always has been my favourite equity story in Asia. It’s still got a big weighting in India. We can argue about the details of what stocks to own etc, but fundamentally this has India. Secondly, China if I did not have a big capital orientation, then I would have less in China, more in smaller Asian markets like Indonesia and Philippines.That’s the performance of my long-only portfolio compared with the benchmarks. Since I cannot really have cash, as I said, so I cannot really hedge it, but for those who want to hedge I have been recommending since the middle of over 2007 that investors hedge this long Asian exposure by shorting western financial stocks. I have now narrowed that down in recent months into not shorting western financial stocks, but shorting European financial stocks because European financial stocks are much more geared to the systemic risk from junk European government debt and they are also in a much more leverage than American financial stocks.This is my global portfolio I have also been running since 2002. This has run on a theoretical US dollar denominated pension fund on a 5-year view and this portfolio I have simplified in recent months have got 15% weighting in US 30 year treasury bonds. That might seem crazy to people given the fact that the US government debt is getting bigger & bigger, but one of my views is that the most likely end game is a sovereign debt crisis in the US and the collapse of the US dollar paper standard. I don't think that end game happens this year and in my view before this oust in the game is played out the deflationary pressures in the US will take bond yields much lower. So I think it’s quite possible the 10-year Treasury goes 2%, 30 year treasury goes to 3%. For people who think that’s insane, I should point out that the 10-year GDP went below 1% this week and in 2003 got to 0.45 basis points.So the message is that in deflationary environment bond thing gets very low indeed because the risk aversion causes people like banks, insurance companies, individuals to buy bonds to lock in income because in deflationary environment there is not much income around. So that’s the deflationary hedge, but 45% of my portfolio is geared to the best story in the world, which is Asia.So I got 15% in Asia or ex-Japan physical property, 30% in my long-only Asia or ex-Japan portfolio. Then I got a longstanding position in gold and gold mining stocks which I have since inception of this portfolio and this position in gold is basically hedging for US dollar denominated pension funds. The big picture risk is that one day simply the world revolt against the ongoing US stimulus and there is a sovereign debt crisis in the US dollar, US government debt, which means the end of the US paper standard and the end of the post 1945 Western paper currency system. And in that environment gold can go parabolic. My longstanding target for gold that can peak in this bull market is $35000 per ounce.So this is a gold bullion chart in US dollar terms. The key point about this chart is that it’s quite obvious gold is in a bull market and remains in a bull market and this bull market, when it ends, will end in a parabolic spike which we have not seen yet. The next obvious trigger for the next big move in gold will be the next time Mr. Bernanke adopts quantitative easing and the next time he does it he who is going to have to expand the balance sheet more than the last time (because otherwise people are going to worry if it’s going to work), but cannot do it right now because the news flow is not bad enough.Gold stocks relative to gold bullion price. In my view gold stocks made that relative low to gold bullion price in 2008 when commodities collapsed. So for equity managers who cannot buy pure bullion I would say look at gold mining stocks because if gold goes $35000 per ounce, it is going to be massive operating leverage for those mine. Gold stocks that actually produce gold haven’t hedge the gold and on jurisdictions where governments don’t cease the gold often.I am turning to some Asian Pacific charts. I will just run through few charts on China that’s a big story for everywhere as I say Chinese market has underperformed this year. The key point to understand about Chinese stocks is that they are policy-driven. Indian stocks are earnings-driven while Chinese stocks are policy-driven. The Chinese government is tightening, that is why the market has been going down. When the Chinese government starts easing, the Chinese stocks will go up and then may be outperforming Indian stocks for a period.Real GDP growth in China. China growth peaked in my view first quarter. It’s going to be slowing for the rest of this year probably an annualised growth 12% first quarter, may be down to 1% by the fourth quarter. That is going to create a lot of market noise. It will be negative for commodities. It’s not a big deal, but it will create a lot of noise. Chinese bank landing has slowed dramatically this year from the surge last year. China is a command economy banking system. So that looks dramatic, but that has seen the loan growth slowing to 18% which is still respectable, it’s not cold turkey.China has been tightening on the property market. So what the stock market in China wants to see is more and more developers willing to cut property prices because it’s more than evident that developers are stopping raising prices and starting to cut prices. The greater the hope that the Chinese government stops tightening that process should play out in the next few months. As you can see here average daily residential sales of Chinese properties have fallen pretty dramatically since April when the government got more aggressive on tightening. You’d have read a lot about Chinese property bubbles, especially in America.The Chinese property markets have a lot of excess supply, but it’s not a bubble because you have very conservative mortgage financing. What you do have there is a lot of high end developments sitting 80% empty. So Chinese people like to have lot of flat value and don’t like to have flats once used because they think a used flat is devalued just like a used car.What about the currency? When the renminbi starts to rise against the US dollar incrementally, maximum incremental appreciation will be of 5%. So the Chinese are going to let their currency go up slightly, but you are not going to get any aggressive moves.I got a chart on Hong Kong just to highlight that we have got a big long-term asset inflation story in Asia. The quintessential asset inflation story in Asia is Hong Kong because of the supply constraints. In my view, Hong Kong property would sooner or later exceed 1997 peaks. You can get a mortagage in Hong Kong today for less than 1%. There you see, apart from Mumbai, this is a one property market in Asia with the massive supply constraint. This is a new supplier residential properties. So Hong Kong I think is a classic asset inflation story to monitor.Turning to India, I would not go too much linked to India because everybody over here would know more about it than me, but we probably had a big inflation scare at the start of this year. In my view, it’s fundamentally silly to worry too much about inflationary pressures in Asia. We should be celebrating the fact that there is inflation because if there wasn’t inflationary pressures in Asia, it would mean the world is facing a global depression because there is no growth dynamics in the developed world. So I am glad there is inflationary pressure. Having said that inflation is going to be coming off in India for the rest of this year which means that concern should recede. The central bank will continue to tighten incrementally. I think that’s sensible given the external environment, but I think incremental tightening that the RBI is doing is enough to upset stocks here unduly.Bank credit growth. This I think is a very important chart. The Indian banking sector is a capitalist banking system unlike the Chinese system. So when the economies slow, the banks slow their lending whereas in China they were ordered to lend more. Now the credit cycle is picking up again, that’s a very healthy development. We are looking at about 20% loan growth in India this year. But I think the most important positive points of all is that the credit cycle is being led by infrastructure loans, not personal loans, as you can see from this chart. This raises the key point which in my view is the critical bearable for the Indian macroeconomic story this year and for the next 5 to 10 years is whether we can get an infrastructure cycle playing out.The fact that infrastructure loans are leading the credit cycle is anecdotal evidence that is happening. If we get infrastructure happening in India, it’s quite possible that India can grow at 9% plus a year for the next 5 years at least, if not 10 years, which means that India in my view is going to be growing more rapidly than China. In my view a more basic trend growth in China is going to be 8% and that’s a growth rate that Chinese Communist party is going to be comfortable with. So the higher growth rate in India than in China, if the infrastructure story happens, is going to raise the profile of the Indian story globally.Clearly if I am wrong and infrastructure does not happen in India, the whole Indian story becomes much less interesting. It’s not a disaster, but the country only grows just 5%-6%. So this is fixed investment relative to GDP in India. I am expecting this line to pick up again. Car sales, two-wheelers sales are going up. So the consumer story is still perfectly good story in India. It has picked up with the monetary easing, but as I say the key variable for me is infrastructure.In terms of risks to the Indian markets, probably the biggest risk to the Indian market is simply the huge amount of foreign money. My own guess is that the next time there is a global hiccup, foreigners will sell India less aggressively than in 2008 for the simple reason that India has shown it can decouple from the US economic cycle.The other point is the fact that foreign investors stay much in India is basically confirmation that India is a good story and those foreign investors who have not yet invested in India are all desperately waiting for a correction. So they can invest, that’s the mindset of them.One year forward price to book. India is not cheap, but it’s not expensive in the context of Indian stock market history and in my view the Indian stock market will continue to trade at a premium to Asian and mother of emerging markets because the Indian market is like one big growth stock and growth stocks trade at a premium. Clearly, if you want to enter in an equity portfolio for dividends & you don’t buy India, then you should go and look at Singapore.This chart perceives a useful chart for anybody who is trying to raise Indian funds in the room because it shows a huge outperformance of India - MSCI India relative to MSCI China in recent history. I will just end with the 3 charts on Japan & the reason I am doing this is because of my experience when I lived in Japan in the early 90s and the experience of Japan in the last 20 years is a potential lead indicator of what is going to happen in the West.

		            Market may trade in a range, but FIIs seen sold on IndiaSECTIONSMarket may trade in a range, but FIIs seen sold on IndiaPTILast Updated: Aug 09, 2010, 01:05 AM ISTRate StoryShareFont SizeAbcSmallAbcMediumAbcLargeSavePrintCommentSynopsisMarket may see range-bound trading this week in the absence of any major trigger.NEW DELHI: Dalal Street is expected to see range-bound trading this week in the absence of any major trigger either on the domestic or global front, say analysts.“Though the market has been moving up it seems to be running out of steam as the indices are still moving within a strong range,” according to broking house ICICI Direct.“In terms of valuation and from the angle of risk-return trade-off also, the domestic market is looking slightly vulnerable and is likely to see some downward correction in the short-term,” it adds.Despite the overall rise, the domestic market has been under-performing against most of its global peers including China, which has seen a 19% rise in the same time period.“Investors are cautious and the market is likely to see a side-way trading this week,” said Bonanza Portfolio assistant vice-president for research Avinash Gupta.Analysts further say, following the negative global cues, the market may open with negative bias on Monday, however, it may bounce back later on fund inflow.“Tracking the weak US and European markets, Dalal Street may open with a negative bias on Monday. However, FIIs are still bullish about the India growth story and a sustained inflow will help the market to bounce-back,” said Geojit BNP Paribas research head Alex Mathews.Foreign Institutional Investors are positive on the domestic market and last week itself infused a net of `5,590 crore in local stocks, taking their total investment so far in 2010 to `51,185 crore as per the data with Sebi.“Global parameters will be important to decide the direction of the domestic markets,” added Mr Mathews .On the domestic front, the faster progress of the monsoon remains the key factor for the market. The IIP figures for June, which are due this week, will also be important and needs to be watched.Domestic markets recovered during the past week and both indices made their fresh 2010 highs, as FIIs continued their buying spree. On a week-on-week basis, the Sensex went up by about 276 points, or 1.5%, to close at 18,143.99.On Friday, Wall Street too settled in the red on sluggish jobs market data and unimpressive July retail sales figures. The Dow Jones lost 0.20% and S&P 500 ended 0.37% lower.Don’t miss out on ET Prime stories!

		            'Don't bank only on price-to-earning ratio'SECTIONS'Don't bank only on price-to-earning ratio'By Madhu T, TNNLast Updated: Aug 09, 2010, 03:55 AM ISTRate StoryShareFont SizeAbcSmallAbcMediumAbcLargeSavePrintCommentSynopsisMany experts believe that looking at PE ratio in isolation won’t help investors grasp realities of the mkt and higher valuation may not be the only deciding factor driving mkt. 
Mumbai: Valuations have been the big buzzword on Dalal Street for a while now but its suddenly gaining momentum. These days every conversation begins with the P/E ratio (price to earning ratio, which compares the current price of the share with its per share earnings) and ends with a loud proclamation that the valuations look ‘a bit stretched.’However, many experts believe that looking at a ratio in isolation won’t help investors grasp the realities of the market and a higher valuation may not be the only deciding factor driving the market.‘‘Valuations matter in the long run, but it need not have an impact in the short run. This is because there is never a right valuation for a stock, as it is a highly individual call,’’ says Mukesh Dedhia, director, Ghalla & Bhansali Securities. ‘‘For example, a stock with a higher P/E may be moving ahead further as there is greater demand for the stock because of its higher earnings possibility. So, there is always a bit of confusion about the right valuation,’’ he adds.‘‘If you look at the broader market, it is difficult to get a value pick. But if you are doing a bottom up method, you would still find many stocks in the market with the right valuation,’’ says Rajiv Thakkar, CEO, Parag Parikh Financial Advisory Services. Though he is a firm believer of value investing, he says looking at a ratio alone won’t be the right way to investing in a stock. ‘‘There are many things you have to consider. For example, you have to find out whether the growth rate is sustainable or how much capital is required to keep the growth. Sometimes, there would be volume growth, but the margins could be under pressure. There are a host of issues to consider, just looking at a ratio is not enough,’’ he adds.Some experts also believe that the higher valuations could be justified if foreign investors continue to pump money into the stock market with the hope of better performance by Indian companies. ‘‘The current valuations doesn’t justify the long term growth potential of India. The market is trading 17 times the earnings potential in 2011 and around 13.8 times the earnings forecast for 2012. It even carry a premium of around 50% to other emerging markets and around 25% premium to other global markets,’’ says Devendra Nevgi, Founder & Principal Partner, Delta Global Partners. He believes that the premium can be justified if the foreign investors continue to bet on Indian stocks. Don’t miss out on ET Prime stories!

With a difficult FY10E and full-tax FY11E, the two-year earnings CAGR (FY09-11) for the company is unlikely to be over 10-15%, it adds. According to the broking house, the company���s pricing power in fresh contracts would remain under pressure as ���pricing behaviour by competition has turned aggressive in new contracts.��� While Infosys has seen some weakness in the BFSI domain in the recent past, the outfit expects this weakness to ���spread to retail and possibly the manufacturing domains as well.��� Of the various service lines, Enterprise Solutions may be worst affected over the next few quarters, according to the management, it adds. The broking house is also expecting another reduction in US dollar guidance by Infosys. Don’t miss out on ET Prime stories!

		            Fin Crisis: Too late and too little done in USSECTIONSFin Crisis: Too late and too little done in USPTILast Updated: Dec 05, 2008, 02:05 AM ISTRate StoryShareFont SizeAbcSmallAbcMediumAbcLargeSavePrintCommentSynopsisA crisis of $240 trillion cannot be stemmed with bailout packages of $1 to $10 trillion. 2008: Year of global financial crisis | Survive credit crisis | Ghosts of 1929AHMEDABAD: Its too late and too little done in the US to come out of the financial turmoil, a crisis of 240 trillion $ cannot be stemmed with bailout packages of 1 to 10 trillion $, Arun Kumar, professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University said here on Thursday.""When the US president elect Barrack Obama assumes office in January, the crisis will still be bigger,"" Kumar said while delivering lecture on Current Financial Turmoil and Lesson for Future at Ahmedabad Management Association today.""150 billion $ tax cut package for the housing sector was too little and too late to stem the collapse of a much higher magnitude,"" Kumar said adding ""Every aspect of financial sector got sucked into the financial turmoil.""""In last two decades the financial markets in US got deregulated, under the guidance of Alan Greenspan as he worked on assumption that markets are self stabilising, but in a recent testitmony Greenspan admitted he was wrong for 16 years,"" Kumar said while quoting a US leading daily.This deregulation led to the collapse of Lehman Brothers, Bear Stern and other troubled entitites, he added.""Government has intervened, crisis has slowed down, but there is crisis of confidence now amongst the banks. The financial and money markets work on certain degree of trust and confidence and this should not be shattered at any cost,"" he added.""Collapse in US was so sharp against the gradual rise because the banks were interlocked in deals. Due to deregulartion there were instruments promising much higher returns and even a marginal fall in assest pricing triggered it all,"" Arun Kumar said.US economy was thriving on borrowed funds, so post crisis countries such as Japan, China, Iceland, Ukraine and others are in deep trouble. China is finding ways to delink from dollar, after corporate profits began falling showing early signs of heading into recession, Arun Kumar said.Now protectionism of economy has creeped in due to lack of confidence, that too is dangeorus, he cautioned. So when the US President-elect Barrack Obama joins office he would prioritise job creation in sectors like BPO and call centres, Kumar said adding, in the past 1.5 billion job loss has been reported in US.So at this historic juncture a out-of-box re-architecturing is required for the $ 600 trillion financial sector, he added.In the backdrop of such a scenario the G-20 initiative is important and extensive coordination between the government's including Indian should be evolved to come over it, Kumar added.Don’t miss out on ET Prime stories!

		            Weak rupee takes its toll on cos with huge foreign debtSECTIONSWeak rupee takes its toll on cos with huge foreign debtBy Santanu Mishra, ET BureauLast Updated: Oct 01, 2008, 08:40 AM ISTRate StoryShareFont SizeAbcSmallAbcMediumAbcLargeSavePrintCommentSynopsisThe falling rupee will severely affect the small companies, whereas the big ones will be impacted moderately. Get rid of Debt | Adopt correct investment strategiesThe global economic crisis is beginning to weigh heavily on India Inc���s balance sheet, courtesy the depreciating rupee. While a weakening rupee might bring cheer to export-oriented sectors such as IT and textiles, it has pushed up the foreign exchange liabilities of Indian companies. Accounting rules, called AS-11 provisions, make it mandatory for companies to make mark-to-market provisions in their profit & loss accounts for any changes in foreign currency loans. The worst hit have been those companies that predominantly serve the domestic market and opted for foreign currency loans to finance their growth plans.According to an analysis by ETIG, the profitability of companies will be dented by mark to market (MTM) losses. Tata Steel may report a forex loss of around Rs 344 crore, whereas Tata Motors could take a hit of Rs 311 crore. Tata Chemicals, which took a foreign currency loan of $475 million to fund its overseas acquisitions, is estimated to report a forex loss of Rs 187 crore. Ranbaxy, JSW Steel and Firstsource Solutions will lose Rs 100 crore and Rs 400 crore each. The list of companies is not exhaustive as an estimated dozen companies raised forex debt last year. Thankfully, this is only an accounting entry and does not affect the cash flows. However, it is likely to be read negatively by the stock market. Market participants actively track companies��� net profits and any adverse development does affect valuations. The rupee had positively impacted most of the above companies till last year, but it has depreciated by over 9% in the quarter ended September 2008.When the rupee depreciates, the value of foreign currency liability denominated in rupee terms increases and vice versa. According to AS-11 stipulations, an increase in liability should be reflected in the quarterly profit and loss statement and will translate into lower corporate profits. Most companies are focused on the domestic market and are therefore unlikely to benefit from a weakening rupee.The falling rupee will severely affect the small companies, whereas the big ones will be impacted only moderately. Firstsource Solutions may report a net loss, while Tata Steel might see a 100 basis points decline in net profit margin on account of forex losses. To put things in perspective, most companies will experience a 10-50% hit on their operating profits.Companies such as Reliance Communication, Reliance Industries and Bharti Airtel follow schedule-VI of the Companies Act, instead of AS-11 and are therefore unlikely to see an impact on their quarterly profit and loss statements. The operating profits of the two Reliance companies would have been lower by around Rs 800-900 crore if they had subscribed to the AS11 norms.Don’t miss out on ET Prime stories!

		            Wait for more signals before turning positiveSECTIONSWait for more signals before turning positiveBy MK Srivatsan, Last Updated: Jul 28, 2008, 04:10 AM ISTRate StoryShareFont SizeAbcSmallAbcMediumAbcLargeSavePrintCommentSynopsisAt the recent low of 12514 points, the Sensex has tested the 12800-12000-pts support zone and has since then attempted a corrective rally.At the recent low of 12514 points, the Sensex has tested the 12800-12000-pts support zone and has since then attempted a corrective rally. During the past trend phases in the Sensex, a monthly moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) cross-down below its trigger line, have, typically, led to a significant value erosion, with the corrective phase lasting, at least, for a year.Therefore, immediate rallies would be interpreted as corrective in nature until the medium-term technical parameters turn positive. The recent upmove in the Sensex since the low of 12514 pts has been very sharp. The upside gap of July 23, 2008 had created a bullish ���Island Reversal Gap��� on the daily charts between 14510 pts and 14519 pts. Normally, the implications of this on the medium-term outlook would be very positive, especially since the ���Island��� comprised of 22 trading sessions. When a stock indicates an uptrend, trades above the gap which occurs, then gaps back down and trades below the initial price, an island reversal has occurred. However, the Sensex has since run into a strong resistance zone between 15026 pts and 15390 pts. The monthly mid-point of June 2008 is at 15026 pts. The 50% retracement level of the fall from the May 2008 peak (17735 pts) is at 15124 pts. The positive implications of the bullish ���Island Reversal Gap��� would thus get negated if the Sensex has a daily close below 14104 pts (the close on July 22, 2008). The Sensex is then expected to have an initial downside of 13513 pts, the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent rise from 12514 pts to 15130 pts. If the bearish ���Island reversal gap��� of 14484-14568 pts is immediately filled and the Sensex manages to decisively overhaul the resistances between 15130 pts and 15390 pts, the ongoing upmove would continue. The Sensex may then test higher levels between 16618 pts and 16860 pts. The 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level of the fall from the May 2008 peak is at 16618 pts while 16860 pts is the 50% retracement level of the entire fall from the January 2008 peak. Hence, one would await further confirmation before turning positive on the medium-term outlook. (The author is VP of technical research at Darashaw)Don’t miss out on ET Prime stories!

Successful business formulaNEW DELHI: Notwithstanding the turmoil in global economic environment, as many as six Indian firms, including Reliance Comm and Bharti Airtel, have been named among top 100 best-performing infotech companies in the world by a US magazine BusinessWeek. The BusinessWeek's latest annual list 'The Infotech 100', which ranks the firms on the basis of shareholder return, return on equity, total revenues and revenue growth, has ranked telecom major Bharti Airtel at the 21st position followed by Reddington India (55th) and RCom (66th). The list is topped by US firms --Amazon.com and Apple-- who have taken the top two spots this year. However, the magazine said in an accompanying report that ""the dominance of US companies is in decline, the country has 33 companies among the IT 100 this year, down from 43 in 2007."" Other Indian firms on the list, includes -- Azim Premji-led Wipro at the 74th position, Satyam at 91 rank and HCL Technologies has been ranked at the 95th position among the list of 100 firms. South African telecom firm MTN Group, which is in exclusive talks with Anil Ambani Group flagship firm Reliance Communications, has been ranked at the 12th position in the global list even ahead of global IT giants IBM and Microsoft, which are at 13th and 23rd ranks in the list, respectively. Besides, the other fast emerging country China also has six companies among the top 100 Infotech companies in the world. The magazine has compiled the information for the list by sorting through the financial results of 30,500 publicly traded companies and has ranked the technology players on four criteria --shareholder return, return on equity, total revenues and revenue growth. The companies leading the list are those with the lowest aggregate ranking. The companies which qualified had to have revenues of at least 300 million dollar then the collection of about 800 companies was divided into eight industry categories, such as software and semiconductors. ""Companies whose stock price has dropped more than 75 per cent, whose sales shrank, or where other developments raised questions about future performance were eliminated from contention. ""We also dropped some phone companies whose monopoly or near-monopoly power gives them an unfair advantage over competitors,"" the magazine added. Don’t miss out on ET Prime stories!

		            Indian firms slip in global ranking; four move out of Top-500SECTIONSIndian firms slip in global ranking; four move out of Top-500PTILast Updated: Jun 29, 2008, 11:38 AM ISTRate StoryShareFont SizeAbcSmallAbcMediumAbcLargeSavePrintCommentSynopsis14 firms present in a new list of world's 500 most valued firms together seeing an erosion of about $150 billion in their market value in the first three months of this year.LONDON: The upheaval in stock market has taken a toll on the global rankings of Indian companies, with 14 of them present in a new list of world's 500 most valued firms together seeing an erosion of about $150 billion in their market value in the first three months of this year. While 13 of the 14 present in the latest list have taken a dip in their rankings, four companies -- Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Petroleum, state-run Indian Oil Corp (IOC), realty major Unitech and housing loan giant HDFC -- have completely moved out of the league. The latest FT Global 500 list was published by the UK business daily Financial Times over this weekend, is based on the companies' market capitalisation as on March 31, 2008. The previous rankings were based on December 2007-end figures. Reliance Industries, flagship company of India's biggest corporate house Mukesh Ambani group, is top ranked 80th in the latest list, topped by the US energy giant ExxonMobil. Except for tobacco-to-consumer goods major ITC, ranked 484th, all other Indian companies have seen their rankings decline from the previous list. Together, the market value of these 14 firms has dropped by about $ 150 billion since December last year and currently stands at about $ 440 billion. There were 17 Indian companies in the previous list and had a total market capitalisation of about $ 590 billion. In the country-wise ranking based on total market cap of all their companies present in the list, India has been placed 15th. The US is at the top with 169 companies worth a total $ 9.6 trillion, followed by UK, China, France and Japan. Other countries ranked ahead of India include Germany, Canada, Switzerland, Russia, Spain, Brazil, Hong Kong, Italy and Australia. In terms of the number of companies present in the list, India and Russia are jointly ranked ninth after the US (169), the UK (35), Japan (39), France (31), China (25), Canada (24) and Germany (22). Among the Indian firms, RIL is followed by two state-run firms ONGC and NTPC at 148th and 206th positions respectively. While RIL has slipped 15 positions from its 65th rank in the previous list, ONGC and NTPC have also moved down from their 115th and 163rd ranks previously. Other Indian firms include Sunil Mittal-led telecom giant Bharti Airtel at 218th (down from 193), realty major DLF at 329th (down from 195) and Anil Ambani-led Reliance Comm at 350th position (down from 252). However, ITC climbed six spots to the 484th place, even as its market cap fell to $ 19.38 billion from $ 20.8 billion previously. Realty major DLF saw the steepest market value fall of $ 40.66 billion, followed by the country's biggest private sector lender ICICI Bank with a plunge of $ 38.51 billion and Steel Authority of India ($ 35.46 billion). RIL, the country's most valued firm, saw its market cap falling by about $ 21 billion, dipping from about $ 105 billion to $ 82 billion in the latest list. In the global list, ExxonMobil has replaced China's PetroChina at the top, while US industrial conglomerate GE has retained its third position. Other firms in the top 10 include Gazprom, China Mobile, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Microsoft, AT&T, Royal Dutch Shell and P&G. Don’t miss out on ET Prime stories!

RRR’S NAATU NAATUFor those unaware, Alia Bhatt played the role of Sita in SS Rajamouli’s period drama. The movie also featured Ajay Devgn, Olivia Morris, Shriya Saran, and Ray Stevenson alongside Jr NTR and Ram Charan. The song Naatu Naatu from the Telugu film won the best original song Oscar nomination last month. The song has been a favourite at recent award ceremonies and will be up against heavyweights such as Lady Gaga and Rihanna, whose songs are also nominated in the same Oscars category in next month's Academy Awards.

The deal size is estimated to be between USD 8-8.5 billion.""The deal is positive for the stock, as even the lower- end of the deal ($8 billion) will value Cairn India at USD 15.7 billion compared to the current market cap of $14.4 billion,"" Elara Securities analyst Alok Deshpande said.""In the short term, we expect the stock to rally towards the deal valuation upon the official announcement, which is expected on August 16, according to media reports,"" he added.Cairn India's parent company, Cairn Energy Plc, also zoomed nearly 2 per cent on the London Stock Exchange and was being quoted at 4.61 pounds in late afternoon trade.In contrast, NRI billionaire Anil Agarwal-led Vedanta Resources Plc plunged by 5.5 per cent to 20.61 pounds on the LSE.In addition, Sterlite Industries, a Vedanta Group firm, sank by over 4 per cent to close at Rs 160.70 on the Bombay Stock Exchange. Sterlite was the biggest loser in the Sensex pack today.""If the deal happens, it is obvious that Vedanta is planning to be a long-term investor. In that case, we feel the deal valuation is fair, considering our expectations of a reserve upside from other Rajasthan fields in some time in the future,"" Deshpande said.Don’t miss out on ET Prime stories!

Vedanta opened on a positive note, but soon swung into the red.LONDON/MUMBAI: Shares of NRI billionaire Anil Agarwal-led Vedanta Resources on Friday plunged 5.59 per cent on the London Stock Exchange amid talk that it may acquire a majority stake in the Indian arm of Cairn Energy.In the late afternoon session, the scrip was being traded at 20.61 pounds, down by 5.50 per cent on the LSE. Vedanta opened on a positive note, but soon swung into the red.The broader market was also weak and the benchmark FTSE 100 was trading at 5,248.95, down 0.32 per cent in the late afternoon session.On the other hand, Cairn Energy Plc climbed 1.41 per cent and was being quoted at 4.59 pounds on the LSE.In India too, Vedanta Group firm Sterlite Industries sank by over 4 per cent to close at Rs 160.70 on the Bombay Stock Exchange. Sterlite was the biggest loser in the Sensex pack today.In contrast, Cairn Energy Plc's Indian arm, Cairn India, surged by over 5 per cent to hit its highest-ever level of Rs 358 on the BSE. The scrip ended with a gain of 355.45, up 4.36 per cent.Vedanta Resources Plc is in talks to acquire a majority 51 per cent stake in Cairn India for about USD 8-8.5 billion (nearly Rs 40,000 crore) and a deal may be announced on Sunday evening or Monday.Scottish explorer Cairn Energy Plc, which holds a 62.37 per cent stake in India-listed Cairn India, is seeking up to a 20 per cent premium for passing on the controlling stake, two persons in-the-know of the development said.Agarwal ""is meeting Cairn Energy Plc Chief Executive Bill Gammell in London today and the deal is likely to be announced as early as Sunday evening or on Monday,"" one of them said.The deal will be contingent on government approval, as Cairn's three producing oil and gas assets, including the giant Rajasthan fields, and seven exploration blocks either have explicit provisions for seeking prior approval before the transfer of interest or gives pre-emption, or the right of first refusal, on any shares being sold to partners like ONGC.Don’t miss out on ET Prime stories!

The FM must rethink his medium-term debtto-GDP target. This refers to ‘We withdrew stimulus last year!’ (ET, Mar 4). TT Ram Mohan has rightly suggested that the tax-GDP ratio measures structural improvement. The FM must rethink his medium-term debtto-GDP target. Losing substantial revenues by cutting I-T rates seems odd. If oil breaches $75-80, the FM will have to hike petroproduct prices and borrow more. Most sectors like FMCG are raising prices sharply due to hikes in excise duties and fuel taxes. Macro-economic conditions like hefty government borrowings, tight monetary control and a fiscal strategy relying on uncertain disinvestment/spectrum auction proceeds, will impinge on private investments in 2010-11.

This refers to your edit ‘India needs new banks’ (ET, Mar 4). Financial inclusion and financial literacy will be the paramount objective while implementing reforms along with UID project to protect the interests of poor. Modern banking system has lost apersonal touch. Even citizens from semi-urban areas are reluctant to use ATMs. NextGen banking may fail in rural areas. It’s true we need more banks and innovative way of thinking, competition will drive away inefficient players. ET has also suggested the perfect solution to the problem in the same edition, ‘Before they compete, let banks consolidate’. Narasimhan panel too has suggested to have less number of banks with more branches at the national level. The author has pointed out that of 9,000 private bank branches, just 1,138 are located in rural areas. This means they are not keen to go rural.

AdvertisementAnkita GargNew Delhi,UPDATED: Feb 27, 2023 18:03 ISTA former Google India employee laid off after he received star performer award.In ShortGoogle fired an Indian employee after giving him “star” performer of the month badge.Google has previously clarified that it is eliminating people based on performance.The company has sacked as many as 12,000 employees in global regions.By Ankita Garg: In the past few weeks, Google has fired thousands of employees in different regions, which also includes India. One of them is also a Hyderabad-based man who got laid off by the tech company for no valid reason. Harsh Vijayvargiya, the former Google employee, has penned down an emotional note on LinkedIn, saying that he was speechless after he found out that he is one of the 12,000 workers that the company has eliminated.advertisementThe employee asserted that Google fired him even after rewarding him with a “star” performer of the month badge, which came as a big surprise and made him curious as to why the company eliminated him. ""My first question was 'why me' even though I was the star performer for the month still why me? And there was no answer at all,"" he wrote on LinkedIn.It is worth mentioning that Google has previously clarified that the layoff is based on the performance of employees and some other factors have also been taken into the consideration. In a blog post, Google announced that the company has undertaken a rigorous review across product areas and functions to ensure that people and roles are aligned with the highest priorities. Google’s CEO has apologised for the decision and even promised to offer severance pay to the impacted ones.Harsh Vijayvargiya, who got eliminated via an email, says his salary is half for two months and the layoff decision has ruined his financial planning. “I used to have 5-day work from office and was habituated to enroute office daily is now at home. I have a kid and a supportive wife who are always there for me, though I was not available for them because of working hours. This took place on Saturday and it took me two days to jot down strength and get back to things and now fight back for survival.”Aakriti Walia, another laid-off Google employee who worked at the company as Cloud Program Manager in Gurugram, was also quite disappointed by Google’s decision to layoff even after giving it five years of service. She was locked out of the system just before a meeting that she was supposed to attend officially. Walia was also pretty disappointed and was curious about why Google chose to eliminate her.“As I plan the road ahead from here, the next hardest thing for me right now is – how do I make my six-year-old daughter understand why mumma’s not going to work? Well, that will take its own sweet time.”--- ENDS ---Also Read |  Elon Musk now fires 10 per cent Twitter workforce, nearly 200 employees lose their jobsAlso Read |  OnePlus 11 Concept showcased with Active Cryo Flux liquid cooling technology on a smartphoneAlso Read |  Senior Twitter exec who slept on office floor, worked hardcore for Elon Musk now fired by Twitter boss

AdvertisementDivyanshi SharmaNew Delhi,UPDATED: Feb 27, 2023 18:02 ISTIn ShortInfosys founder Narayan Murthy says that AI won’t replace human beings.He reminded people how the world was initially apprehensive of mobile phones and computers as well.He also added that the human mind is always a step ahead of technology and ultimately becomes the master of it.By Divyanshi Sharma: ChatGPT’s popularity has paved way for various debates and got many people talking about the future of Artificial Intelligence. While some people believe that AI is a threat to the working population and might take over some human jobs, others say that artificial intelligence will help humans with their jobs and lead to more efficiency. Infosys founder NR Narayan Murthy expressed his views about the future of AI and the viral chatbot, ChatGPT, that took the world by storm the moment it launched.advertisementInfosys founder NR Narayan Murthy says AI won’t replace humansAt the 67th Foundation Day of All India Management Association (AIMA) held last week, NR Narayan Murthy said that AI won’t replace human beings as they won’t allow AI to do so, reports Business Today.The report further quotes him saying, “I think there is a mistaken belief that artificial intelligence will replace human beings,  human beings will not allow artificial intelligence to replace them.”On AI making life comfortableThe Infosys founder added that AI has made our life more comfortable by ‘becoming assistive’.“Every one of these technologies has made the life of human beings more comfortable. Computers made our life more comfortable in certain areas. Artificial Intelligence has made our life more comfortable by becoming assistive,” he said. Murthy also said that human beings have the power of the mind which no computer can compete with.The report also quotes him saying that he believes AI will free-up more of human being’s time. However, instead of enjoying that free time, humans will start thinking about new things and will get busier.“AI will lead to more and more free time for human beings but no human being will be satisfied with the free time. This is because human beings will start thinking of new things and they will become more and more busy,” he said.On human mind being a step aheadLastly, Narayan Murthy reminded people how the world was initially apprehensive of mobile phones and computers for similar reasons. He also added that the human mind is always a step ahead of technology and ultimately becomes the master of it. He said, “Many thought at one point of time that all these computers will make us more free. It has not happened.”Talking about human mind remaining a step ahead, he added, “Mind is the most flexible instrument that ever exists in the world, in this planet. It also has higher and higher aspiration. So doesn't matter what technology you will invent. The human being, the human mind is always a step ahead and becomes the master of that technology.""--- ENDS ---ALSO READ |  Cred CEO Kunal Shah reveals his salary, claims he earns Rs 15,000 per monthALSO READ |  Microsoft increases Bing's daily chat limit to 100 per day, details hereALSO READ |  ChatGPT helps company recover Rs 90 lakh from a client who ghosted them over payment, details here

I got a chance to spend some time with the company’s Honor Magic Vs foldable, and here are my impressions. AdvertisementAman RashidBarcelona ,UPDATED: Feb 27, 2023 17:45 ISTIn ShortThe Honor Magic Vs features a 6.4” conventional aspect ratio outer display.The phone is powered by the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 SoC coupled with a large 5000mAh battery.The Honor Magic Vs features a zero-gap hinge mechanism design.By Aman Rashid: Does the name Honor ring a bell? Being the sub-brand of Huawei, there was a time when Honor was killing it in India. Fast forward to 2023, and many don’t even remember the Chinese smartphone maker in the country. That said, Honor still makes phones for the global market, in fact, the company still has a fabulous presence in Europe. And so, I had the chance to visit the Honor booth at this year’s MWC in Barcelona, Spain, where I spent some hands-on time with the Honor Magic Vs, the company’s high-end foldable smartphone. Here are my first impressions of the device. advertisementHonor Magic Vs: Hands-on impressionsWhen I held the Honor Magic Vs in my hand, the first thing I realised was what we are missing in India. So, currently, if you want to buy a foldable smartphone in our country, your only choice is to go for the Galaxy Z Fold series. In fact, many other Chinese phone makers, including Honor, make their foldables for the Chinese and global markets, but it is only Samsung that is selling its foldables in India. As a matter of fact, OPPO has recently entered the Indian foldable market, but they are also not offering their high-end Find N2, but instead, the company has brought the Find N2 Flip, which will be competing with the Galaxy Z Flip 4 in India.This brings me to the Honor Magic Vs, a foldable that I have never seen or experienced before. The first thing that I noticed here was the zero gap between the two displays when you fold the phone shut. This is similar to the OPPO Find N2 Flip, but seeing it with a full-blown foldable smartphone hit differently. So, of course, there is no gap between the screen when folded, and even when you unfold the phone, both the displays go flat, as if there is no hinge. Speaking of which, I would also want to point out the minimal crease. Now, I won’t deny that the crease is not there, it certainly is, but to a point that you will immediately forget about it once you start using it. In fact, it is not even properly visible unless and until light directly hit the surface.  
Of course, not all about the Honor Magic Vs is nice and dandy, and as good as the crease situation is handled, and as good as the no-gap design works, there’s also one thing to note here — the hinge isn’t as good and versatile as the one on the Galaxy Z Fold 4. You see, you can position the Galaxy Z Fold 4 at multiple orientations, and the hinge is firm enough to hold the phone at different angles. But, with the Honor Magic Vs, there’s always a point after which the display completely unfolds, or it completely shuts, which basically means, that the Honor Magic Vs can only support a handful of angles. One other thing that the Honor Magic Vs misses is the under-display camera on the main screen, something that you see on the Galaxy Z Fold 4.But apart from this, the Honor Magic Vs is a delight to hold in the hand. Being a foldable smartphone, it is relatively lightweight and ergonomic. And did you know that this phone employs a 5,000mAh dual-cell battery under the hood, which is 600mAh more than that of the Fold 4! Plus, there’s 66W fast charging support as well, which can fully top up the phone in around 45 minutes from 0 to 100 per cent.  
advertisementApart from this, the Honor Magic Vs is loaded to the brim with all the bells and whistles that you’d expect from a high-end foldable smartphone. The cover display on the phone is a 6.4-inch AMOLED screen, which feels conventional to use when folded. Of course, whenever you need a larger canvas, you can simply unfold and expand your view with the 7.9” AMOLED inner display. And note, that both these panels are 10-bit panels, which gives you a rich and vibrant colour reproduction. The phone is powered by the tried and tested Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 processor, and in terms of software, there’s MagicOS atop Android 13. Now, in the brief time that I had with the phone, I can’t comment on the phone’s overall performance, but I can say one thing — as good as MagicOS would be, I don’t like the look of it. I wasn’t a fan of Huawei’s/ Honor’s Android skin in the past, and I am not a fan even now.Summing up, on a whole, apart from the look of the software, the Honor Magic Vs looked to me as a promising foldable, and it also opened my eyes to the fact that there is a world of foldables outside what Samsung offers. Why I’d like to give the Honor Magic Vs a chance? Well, it is a lightweight foldable, it looks good, it has a traditional outer screen that can be used like how you use a normal phone, the inner display is protected by a side strip, and of course, not to mention the zero-gap hinge mechanism, which makes me think that why hasn’t Samsung been able to offer a solution such as this with their foldables? But again, someday I’d love to do a comparison between a Samsung foldable and an Honor foldable, which I believe is not happening anytime soon. So, a full judgement as to which phone maker has the better foldables, well, I’ll reserve my thoughts for the foreseeable future. For now, I loved spending time with the Honor Magic Vs, and I really wished this phone sold in India. --- ENDS ---

		            After the Oscars, what's next for silent stars of The Artist?SECTIONSAfter the Oscars, what's next for silent stars of The Artist?Last Updated: Feb 29, 2012, 12:51 AM ISTRate StoryShareFont SizeAbcSmallAbcMediumAbcLargeSavePrintCommentSynopsisThe team behind The Artist will have spent the first day of the rest of their lives conforming to the grandest, and most lucrative, of Hollywood traditions. The Independent If they are anything like most Oscar winners, the team behind The Artist will have spent the first day of the rest of their lives conforming to the grandest, and most lucrative, of Hollywood traditions. Having woken up, pinched themselves, and made sure that -oui! - it really was a gold statuette on their bedside table, France's newly minted movie stars are likely to have devoted their waking hours to pondering two pressing questions: how to shift that throbbing hangover, and which of the myriad career choices suddenly on their horizon should they pursue next? Breaking the silence The first will not have been easily answered. Having sought refreshment at the Governor's Ball, the team who won five of Sunday's Academy Awards - including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor - adjourned to a packed party hosted by their film's distributor, Harvey Weinstein, at the Mondrian Hotel in Hollywood. Then they swept through Vanity Fair's bash, before continuing to the Chateau Marmont hotel, where at around four in the morning, several boisterous members of their entourage leapt into the swimming pool, fully clothed. The second post-Oscar question requires even more careful consideration. Like any winners of the biggest accolade in show business, The Artist's leading man Jean Dujardin, director Michel Hazanavicius, and producer Thomas Langmann will, for the time being, be inundated with potential job offers. But, as any Hollywood agent will tell you, an overabundance of choice doesn't always make for easy decisions. Leverage the success On a purely pragmatic level, history suggests that all three can, if they so desire, leverage The Artist's success into financial security. The film has already made $76 million worldwide and is now being widened into more than 2,000 cinemas in the US, with a view to further capitalise on its Best Picture status. As well as ""back end"" earnings from that pot - which must also be dipped into by the voracious Weinstein - they are entitled to use their modish status to secure significant paydays.

This is the fair's 20th edition.
Thomas Abraham


	In Delhi it's that time of year again when publishers, distributors and retailers are scrambling around frantically getting everything from point-of-sale to stocks right. It's the World Book fair (WBF), which comes around once every two years sprawling across the giant halls of Pragati Maidan. This is the fair's 20th edition, and although there are look-alikes all over the country, this one is undoubtedly the mother-of-them all. 


	In the 1980s and the '90s, the Kolkata Book fair was the fair to go. But with the move from the maidan, apart from other venue and organisational problems, Kolkata has had to give up its title. Today the Delhi WBF is a mammoth affair, and has gone beyond just being a sort of retail exhibition. 


	Actually, no book fair in India would really qualify to be a 'trade fair' like Frankfurt or London, where business and rights deals are a norm. But like the Jaipur Literary Fest, what we lack in focus, or 'order and method', we make up for in sheer numbers. 


	The WBF is a giant carnival. The last edition had over 800,000 visitors, and the organizers are wondering whether this year the million mark will be touched, given that the Pragati Maidan now has direct metro connectivity and that admission is free. Certainly the exhibitors have gone up since last time to about 1,300. That's still, of course, less than a tenth of the total number of publishers in the country, as estimated by the various federations who put the count at being well over 15,000.

Month of March


	This year, for the first time, the dates of the WBF moved from the traditional January end to early February period to a whole month down the line. This has met with some consternation as many publishers felt that it was leaving it too late for library budgets, and many schools would have exams on, and that might affect the turnout a bit. The jury is out on that one - the verdict will be out on the 4th of March when it all gets over.


	So what are the business stats from the fair? Herein lies the rub - there are none. Ironically, for an industry that is seeing technological change at a pace like never before, and typically of an industry still coming to grips with management information, there is no reliable data available apart from guesstimates.


	The National Book Trust (NBT) - the fair organizers - blames it on traditional publisher mindsets and the archaic notion of 'business secrets' where exhibitors don't divulge figures. But even just by conservative extrapolation, assuming a Rs 2.5 lakh average turnover per participant (incidentally, the big ones top Rs 20 crore) one is looking at a fair turnover of over Rs 30 crore in cash sales, which is more than three times the business done from all of the leading bookstores all over India in any given week. Trade buying, rights deals, subscription sales, print contracts, and other 'collateral business' are on top of this.

Trade & Rights


	The WBF - indeed the industry - needs to take this to the next level with a dedicated two days for 'trade and rights'. Years ago, the first two hours of the fair every day used to be designated trade hours where librarians and stockists could browse uninterrupted, a practice since discontinued. But if the 9-day fair could be shortened to seven days for consumers with two days as business days, India might yet see the fillip it needs in its rights business, as local-to-international rights networks build.


	India has a large contingent going to Frankfurt but bulk of these is either English publishers-distributors, visiting principals or remainder merchants buying surplus stock. The size of the Indian rights pavilion is testament to the fact that our share of the rights pie is negligible. 


 

	When were the last time you heard of an Indian work in translation break out through a rights purchase the way Wolf-Totem was snapped up from Chinese or The Devotion of Suspect-X from the Japanese? It's only if we build a rights module here within the WBF, that one can gradually work up (yes it will take years) to exploiting the rights potential from Indian languages in translation.


	So what purpose does the fair serve? With the surge in online bookstores, does it still have any relevance? I believe it still has huge relevance. Quite simply it is at its most fundamental, the only real direct interface publishers have with their end readers. This is the only time you can actually put the range you want up there, and watch readers as they browse.


	For most publishers, the long tedious day playing floor assistant and traffic cop rolled into one has its reward in watching that die-hard fan chasing that obscure book you thought would never sell. The ecstasy of finding that long lost book, the agony of seeing something priced beyond one's budget, the amazement at seeing a bargain or combo offer...it's all there every day, hour on hour. For readers, this is the one time you'll get to see, touch, browse lists and full range as you can never anywhere else. 


	Online has its convenience, but by and large you need to know what book you want, notwithstanding the cross recommendations the better sites have. This is where a reader can experience that joy of discovery-where s/he will see full series, obscure imprints, rare titles. 


	Then there are the bargains. Fair rules make it impossible to deep discount but bargain tables with 'fair prices' and combination offers abound. What we have over the nine days of the fair is in essence the world's largest bookstore-over a million square feet of books to choose from-in every Indian language, a lot of foreign ones, and of course English.

WASHINGTON: An elephant figurine, made up of artificial pearls and semi-precious stones, which was gifted by the then Indian Home Minister Lal Krishna Advani to US Secretary of State Colin Powell in 2002, has made its way to the State Department exhibition hall.  	""Secretary Colin Powell received this gift from Indian Minister of Home Affairs Lal Krishna Advani,"" the State Department said in its remarks written at the bottom of the elephant figurine.  	In fact, it is one of the less than 50 gifts among the hundreds of those received by the Secretary of State over the year by foreign dignitaries that have been selected for display at the Exhibit Hall, in the centre of Henry S Truman Building, headquarters of the State Department, official sources said.  	Describing the gift, the State Department said, ""with royal aplomb, the great man rides in the howdah, or canopied seat, as the mahout or guide in front leads the elephant"".  	""This colourful cloisonne figurine harks back to times when elephants were an indispensable part of Indian life - for transportation, fighting battles, protecting land and traversing forests,"" it said.  	The elephant figurine was made by Neeru Goel, an Indian artist from Bengal, who specialises in enamelware sculptures.  	The Department officials, while explaining the reason for the selection of this particular gift from India to be displayed at the exhibition hall, said that elephants are a cultural icon of the country, which over centuries have become a status symbol representing wealth, wisdom, and strength.

Though statistical models will still be used for monsoon forecast, the ministry of earth sciences is putting more emphasis on dynamic models.M Rajeevan of National Atmospheric Research Laboratory said, ""the failure to predict the 2009 drought has raised many serious issues. On the other hand, the state-of-the art coupled ocean atmospheric models have sho-wed improved skills in predicting inter annual variability of Indian summer monsoon rainfall.""He was speaking at the golden jubilee conference of Indian Institute of Climate Change (IITM), Pune, on 'opportunities and challenges in monsoon prediction in changing climate'. Since 2011, the IITM has used the coupled model for monsoon forecast.Better weather forecast needs data from all parts of the globe. ""In every part of the world, farmers are saying that the climate is not as it used to be. Hence, traditional knowledge is also failing. For better prediction of weather, we need observations from all countries. We need super computers of even higher capacities. We need to have knowledge about how to translate scientific progress into concrete applications,"" said Michel Jarraud, secretary general, World Meteorological Organisation.Don’t miss out on ET Prime stories!

		            Documents reveal contents of the first telegraph message between India & EnglandSECTIONSDocuments reveal contents of the first telegraph message between India & EnglandPTILast Updated: Feb 22, 2012, 09:07 AM ISTRate StoryShareFont SizeAbcSmallAbcMediumAbcLargeSavePrintCommentSynopsisNewly discovered documents have revealed the first telegraph messages and joy when England was linked for the first time with India on 23 June, 1870. PTIPORTHCURNO (ENGLAND): Newly discovered documents have revealed the first telegraph messages and joy when England was linked for the first time with India on 23 June, 1870, via thousands of km of cables laid painstakingly below the seas, reducing time from months to minutes.The sylvan Porthcurno valley in Cornwall, located on the Atlantic coast 506 km south-west of London, was the unlikely place of a revolution that enabled Britain and its former colonies to communicate with each other.Museum officials told a visiting PTI correspondent that Porthcurno was the hub of international cable communications from 1870 to 1970, and a training college for the communications industry until 1993.Now a museum housing rare equipment and details of the history of telegraph, Porthcurno has been granted millions of pounds in funding to develop an international education programme that includes community groups in India.Among its rare archives discovered last week is a collection of the first telegraph messages sent from Porthcurno and Mumbai (then Bombay).Until that landmark day, communication between England and India was unreliable, and often took months.According to the document, the first message was dispatched on the night of 23 June, 1870, and a reply was received in 5 minutes, which was a technological feat at the time.The message was called a 'complimentary telegram' between the 'Managing Director in London and the Manager in Bombay'.The first message was from 'Anderson to Stacey: How are you all?', to which the reply was: 'All well'.The second message from Anderson was: 'Please ask gentlemen of the press, Bombay, to send a message to gentlemen of the press, New York'.After several messages that night, including some to the governor of Bombay, from Lady Mayo to viceroy Lord Mayo based in Shimla, and one from the Prince of Wales to the viceroy, a response was received from journalists based in Bombay.It said: 'From the Press of India to the Press of America: The Press of India sends salaam to the Press of America. Reply quick'.The document notes that the viceroy of India had sent a telegraph to the president of the United States and ""received a reply which reached him in 7 hours 40 minutes"".The viceroy's message, which was read in the American Congress the same evening, was: ""The Viceroy of India for the first time speaks direct by telegraph with the President of the United States. May the completion of the long line of uninterrupted communication be the emblem of lasting union between the Eastern and Western World"".Telegraphic communication with India was first established in 1864 by overland telegraph lines from Europe to the top of the Persian Gulf and then by an undersea cable to Karachi, but the overland section was never satisfactory, prompting efforts to lay more reliable cables below the sea.In 1869, telegraph pioneer John Pender established the British Indian Submarine Telegraph Company, whose task was to lay undersea cables to India.The five ships used to lay the thousands of km of cables were the Great Eastern, William Cory, Chiltern, Hawk and Hibernia.It took six weeks to lay the cables from Suez to Bombay. This was followed by the laying of the final link from Malta to Porthcurno.It was the first long distance cable 'chain', and opened to the public with much jubilation, museum records show.After the link with India was established, Porthcurno was linked by undersea cables to several other areas across the world.At its height, it was the world's largest station with 14 cables in operation. Porthcurno's telegraphic codename was 'PK'.During World War II, tunnels were dug by Cornish miners to house an underground building and Porthcurno's entire telegraph operations.The building today houses the museum and archives that started the communication revolution in the late nineteenth century.Besides 1.44 million pounds funding received in January, the museum this week has been granted 35,000 pounds from the international telecommunications organisation SubOptic to develop an education project with community groups in India, among other countries.Museum officials said the money will fund an international education programme that will benefit users from spring 2013.It will include online learning resources, including video clips, animations and games that will enable users to discover the science of global cable-based telecommunications, as well as its impacts on local identity, democracy and culture.Don’t miss out on ET Prime stories!

KOLKATA: Hundreds of worried fans of ailing Bollywood megastar Amitabh Bachchan today performed a yagna here to pray for his speedy recovery.  ""We are using the auspicious occasion of Maha Shivratri to pray to Lord Shiva to help him recover painlessly from his health problems,"" Sourav Banerjee of Amitabh Bachchan Fans Association of Kolkata, told.  	Dressed in traditional attires, hundreds of fans carrying the actor's posters thronged the Ekdaliya Evergreen Park in the afternoon for the hour-long yagna.  	Ever since the news of Big B's health problems broke, his admirers here, who have also built a temple for him in south Kolkata, have been a worried lot.  	""We have been praying for his health and well-being ever since and are constantly monitoring media reports on his health,"" Banerjee said.  	Another of his fan blamed the actor's ""workaholic nature"" for his medical condition.  	""He has delivered hits after hits all his career and at this age of his life his body needs rest,"" said 32-year-old Goutam Basak adding that they are planning a gala celebration when the superstar returns home from hospital.  	On February 11, 69-year-old Bachchan underwent an abdominal surgery but after he complained of acute pain, his stay at the hospital had to be extended.  	Currently recuperating at the Seven Hills hospital, Big B's health is now said to be improving. Don’t miss out on ET Prime stories!

England were 48 for one at stumps on pulsating day four, needing 210 runs to secure victory and a series sweep.ENG vs NZ, 2nd Test: Day 4 HighlightsCrawley was dismissed for 24 by New Zealand captain Tim Southee, but opener Duckett (23 not out) and nightwatchman Ollie Robinson (one not out) negotiated the tense final overs at the Basin Reserve. Earlier, New Zealand were bowled out for 483 in their second innings after tea, setting England a 258-run chase for victory on day four of the second Test.advertisementAfter an inspiring Kane Williamson century raised the hosts' hopes of an unlikely victory, England rattled through the last five wickets after tea to reclaim the lead. Williamson hit 132 and shared a big partnership with wicketkeeper Tom Blundell (90), frustrating the English bowlers from start to finish.They had resumed after the break on 423 for five, looking well set to continue. Enter golden boy Harry Brooks, who provided an unlikely breakthrough for England with his part-time medium pace, catching Williamson down the legside. New Zealand promptly collapsed, losing four of their last five wickets. 

Day four finishes with the second Test nicely poised in Wellington.

All-rounder Michael Bracewell was run out for eight when he failed to ground his bat, a colossal error given that he had jogged well past the line when Ben Foakes whipped off the bails.The wicket exposed the tail, and Southee was quickly out slogging for two runs. Leach dismissed tailender Matt Henry for a duck and Blundell for 90, finishing with a five-wicket haul for the innings as compensation for a massive 61.3-overs shift.After chasing down a slew of big scores in the home summer, England will fancy their chances of reeling in the remaining runs on day five. New Zealand, on the other hand, will be disappointed that they did not set a higher fourth-innings target.--- ENDS ---Also Read |  Ross Taylor reacts to Kane Williamson surpassing him to become New Zealand's highest run-scorer in Tests

		            Every decision of government needn’t be a big reform: Anand MahindraSECTIONSEvery decision of government needn’t be a big reform: Anand MahindraBy Satish John, ET BureauLast Updated: Jun 02, 2014, 05:25 AM ISTRate StoryShareFont SizeAbcSmallAbcMediumAbcLargeSavePrintCommentSynopsis""The fact that we are the world’s largest democracy and we are all aware that power and a role in global affairs for a nation comes from economic strength.""ET BureauAnand Mahindra can’t wait to get back home from the US because all the action is happening in India with a new, stable government led by Narendra Modi in place. Hours after chairing a board meeting of Mahindra & Mahindra at midnight US time, the company’s chairman and MD spoke on Saturday to Satish John at length from Boston on his hopes and aspirations for the country. The new administration has begun well and a lot more is expected from it, he said. Excerpts:

On Modi government’s 10-point agenda.

I think it is almost brilliant to put at the head of the list the fact that bureaucrats should be encouraged to take decisions without fear. In a sense he’s gone to the heart of the problem of the paralysis. The Indian government is extraordinarily large and it is difficult to try and believe that one leader can make all the change. This is a federal system. In a large bureaucracy you cannot exercise the transformation of any situation without coopting bureaucracy.

So empowerment becomes important. It’s a good sign. If you remember, one of the major apprehensions about Modi was an autocratic style of functioning. By putting right at the top of the agenda the empowerment of the bureaucracy I think one has to appreciate and admit that it is definitely not the act of an autocrat.

On disbanding ministerial groups.

Without making much heavy weather of it, he’s been a case study for business schools on how to exercise leadership and have an impact from day one in the new job. He’s setting a clear agenda and is making a clear promise of making a measurement of progress made against that clear agenda. For example, making an agenda for 100 days will make it clear what the matrix would be for measuring success of that agenda. It is important that every day some incremental progress is made towards that agenda and that progress is communicated transparently. He has got his team ready, which is a focused team. To me, every decision needn’t be a big-bang reform but a signal of proactive decision-making and removal of red tape and bureaucracy. And a promise of even speedier decision-making in the future.

On the government’s immediate priorities.

Back in the 1980s, I had written a column headlined ‘Roads to Nowhere’. At that time we were not building enough roads. (Among) America’s competitive advantages happen to be its highways and its transportation network. Those are like blood vessels to the economy and they create job opportunities. Therefore, in a funny sense, the best thing anyone can do to create an inclusive economy is ironically through building roads, because access to markets or the lack of access to markets is one of the most discriminatory things one can do to the poor, especially to the rural poor. It’s not a point that we automatically think of but roads are a mechanism to create inclusiveness in the economy. So, I think, the faster he does that the better for the economy. There is huge economic data to show that roads (give) a bigger boost to rural income than even irrigation. It will help power dual income for families and will allow a kind of diversity from dependence on agriculture which creates productivity.


	 
On India-US ties.

I’ve been here (in the US) for quite a while now. The Indian elections have generated enormous interest. Most of the diplomatic and political pundits are now urging the leadership in Washington not to miss out on what they feel is the diplomatic opportunity for the US in reaching out to and rebuilding a very strong relationship with India. They feel US has lost ground because of the visa controversy and that they should now rediscover the ground and build a strong relationship.

There is a feeling that both Japan and China have both stolen a march on building this kind of relationship with India. There is going to be, in my opinion, a strong effort from decision-makers here to reach out to the prime minister and his colleagues to rebuild the relationship.

On the perception that the new government will tilt more toward the east — Japan, China, South Korea.

There has been significant interest shown by Japan. It is a country with a liquidity overhang and an investment surplus. Modi is well aware of that. Why Japanese investors have been holding back is because they did not perceive any of the promises we’ve given to be gaining traction.

In the area of construction and large industrial projects, they can take pole position in large projects here. That being said, everybody speculated what the position of the PM and the Cabinet would be and the PM is his own man. My contention is that our PM is a practical man and he knows that any kind of vindictiveness has no role in foreign policy.

I think his whole objective is to enhance India’s economic health and through that gain what should be India’s rightful role in the world. The fact that we are the world’s largest democracy and we are all aware that power and a role in global affairs for a nation comes from economic strength. I think, in his own way and at the right time, he will respond positively when the correct signals are sent out from the US administration.

On FDI in defence

We have been consistent from the time we entered into JVs with foreign companies. We have not changed our stance. Right from the beginning we have been representing to the government that it is a positive step to allow at least 49% investment through the automatic route. Because it encourages the foreign partner to deploy the technology into the JV. Otherwise, there is wariness on their part to provide 100% support to the joint venture. So if you really want the best technology to be manufactured here, then (it should be) a minimum of 49% stake, which we have always advocated.

On Mahindra’s investments plans.

We have never shied away from making investments. Even during downcycles, we never stopped our investments. We invested in the Chakan automotive plant when the economy was down; we also invested in the tractor plant in Zaheerabad when the tractor market was witnessing a downcycle. When the market improved for tractors we were able to ramp up our output. We always have a long-term view of the economy. We have consistently been investing. In defence, for example, if the government starts buying again for the much-needed upgrade then we’ll certainly make the investments. Pawan (Goenka) has gone on record to say that we are considering a Rs 4,000-crore investment, which is independent of the new developments. It was something we were going to do.

Williamson stayed on for more than two hours on Day 3, taking New Zealand to 202/3 with a slender lead of 24 runs at stumps. He, along with Daryl Mitchell, helped the hosts to swell the lead and along the way Williamson registered his 26th Test hundred soon after the lunch on Day 4.At lunch, New Zealand reached 325/5 with a lead of 99 runs against England. Williamson and Henry Nicholls formed a 55-run partnership before Nicholls (29) was caught at slip by Harry Brook off Ollie Robinson.Williamson was joined by Daryl Mitchell, who raced past his former captain to hit a fifty from 52 balls. Meanwhile, Williamson brought up his 34th Test half-century after spending two-and-a-half hours at the crease. The fifth-wicket stand of 75 runs ended when Mitchell skied one to Joe Root. --- ENDS ---ALSO READ |  Harmanpreet Kaur run out: Alyssa Healy slams India captain, says it's doing those little basics better

		            Narendra Modi has his eyes set on boosting business: Joao Cravinho, EU AmbassadorSECTIONSNarendra Modi has his eyes set on boosting business: Joao Cravinho, EU AmbassadorBy Dipanjan Roy Chaudhury, ET BureauLast Updated: Jun 03, 2014, 05:37 AM ISTRate StoryShareFont SizeAbcSmallAbcMediumAbcLargeSavePrintCommentSynopsisAmbassador Joao Cravinho, head of the EU delegation, led Ambassadors of various European countries to a quiet lunch with Modi at the capital last year.ET Bureau While the world’s democratic superpower was maintaining armslength from Narendra Modi (then Gujarat Chief Minister in 2012-13), Europe led by an European Union delegation in India was quietly engaging with the BJP leader nearly two years before the Lok Sabha elections. In fact, Ambassador Joao Cravinho, head of the EU delegation, led Ambassadors of various European countries to a quiet lunch with Modi at the capital last year. And in the runup to the polls, he even travelled across India to get a sense of the probable outcome and interacted with all players cutting across the political spectrum, something foreign envoys seldom do. In an interview with ET, Ambassador Cravinho described India’s new Prime Minister as a man with clarity of thought who has a clear vision for India and governance. The Ambassador feels that EU member states have the potential to drive Modi’s economic diplomacy and help boost India’s economic health.  How do you view this victory of Narendra Modi and the BJP? And how will it impact the Indian economy?  We want India to do well. This election has ensured that there’s political stability for the next five years. A decisive leadership would mean tougher decisions, and no good governance is possible without tough decisions. The BJP-led NDA has a clear mandate to take bold and innovative decisions. International politics is not about zero-sum game and while India would economically engage other powers, EU has the potential to drive growth in India. EU is already the single biggest trading partner as a bloc, and is the single largest source of FDI for India as a bloc. We are ready to meet India’s needs in the fields of technology and funds.  You have interacted with Modi when he was the Gujarat Chief Minister. How do you rate him as a leader of modern India?  	As a former Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Portugal, I had interacted with various leaders worldwide and I can say that Mr Modi is among the best. He has clarity of thought and clear vision of governance and that’s what India requires. He also has a very clear understanding of the challenges before the country. He is a good listener as well as a good talker and can engage in enriching discussions. No Prime Minister would like to have communal strife on his record, and I am certain that he would not allow any communal tensions in India. His priority is to boost the economy and he has his eyes set on that.  Where do India-EU relations go from here? What are the priority areas for India-EU and what’s the future of Free Trade Agreement that’s being negotiated for many years now?  	Negotiators from India and European Union are on the job to conclude the FTA. The proposed agreement will lead to greater openness. In the past, EU held discussions with the BJP on the FTA. We take Mr Modi’s speech on economic issues on February 27 as a positive. I have no doubt that the FTA will benefit India. We hope that there will be progress in FTA before the next India-EU Summit at Brussels. Don’t miss out on ET Prime stories!

The last few days it's really getting as much practice as possible to get myself back in shape to be able to compete at a high level,"" Djokovic said.""I haven't felt pain on the court for a week. I'm getting closer to 100%. Still not there in terms of the game and how I feel on the court. But the important thing is there's no pain. I don't have a hindrance in the way I move on the court.""After every injury it takes time for mechanisms to be balanced, for adjustments to be done on the court. It takes time to find that groove of moving effortlessly and not thinking about if something's going to happen. I don't have those thoughts.""Djokovic begins the Dubai tournament as the world number one for the 378th time, surpassing Steffi Graf as the player with the most weeks at the top of the sport.""It's surreal to be that many weeks number one, to match Graf - one of the all-time greats,"" Djokovic said. ""Just being amongst these legendary names is flattering. I'm proud of it.""Djokovic will take on Czech Tomas Machac in the first round of the Dubai Open on Tuesday.--- ENDS ---Also Read |  Manchester United win League Cup to end 6-year wait for trophy

		            Confidence level of industry improving: KV Kamath, ICICI BankSECTIONSConfidence level of industry improving: KV Kamath, ICICI BankLast Updated: Jun 24, 2014, 01:45 PM ISTRate StoryShareFont SizeAbcSmallAbcMediumAbcLargeSavePrintCommentSynopsis""It is the collective wisdom of the marketplace that there is action and we will move with speed. That improves the confidence level of industry.""ET NowET Now caught up with KV Kamath, Chairman, ICICI Bank, for his expectations from the Narendra Modi government as well as the Budget. Excerpts:

ET Now: Talking of expectations from Narendra Modi, do not you think too much hope and money in essence is riding behind one man? Despite his good intentions, there are structural problems in the economy and even the Prime Minister does not quite have a magic wand?

KV Kamath: If you look back to 10 years ago, the economy was getting into near double digit growth even with all the structural problems. Now you have a leader who has a known bias for fixing things and making sure that things work. It is the same set of structure, the same set of people who are driving this. You have the right leader who can drive the effort.

ET Now: The other day we had Mr. Birla meet the Finance Minister and as he walked out of the meeting, he said he expects the economy to revive in three to six months. He says he is going to start investing in India now. We have not heard too many corporate leaders say that. You have a pulse of the mood of corporate India. When do you think will the corporate leaders start investing?

KV Kamath: The first sense comes from the market. It is the collective wisdom of the marketplace that there is action and we will move with speed. That improves the confidence level of industry. Now we need to see whether some of the ground conditions that are needed for people to get back to an investment mode are going to change. Today I read that with a large slate of reforms or projects which have been stuck are going to be addressed in the next few days. If that happens, you will see a sea change in the investment mindset, as it were.

ET Now: It could happen in three months itself. Is that what you think?

KV Kamath: I think that between three and six months it could start happening. But we want incremental investment to happen. There is enough to harvest in the first six months in terms of stuck projects and so on.

ET Now: The one cue that corporate India will also look forward to is the budget. Given the nature of the mandate that we have, the strength that this government have in the Parliament, would you expect tough reforms in this budget itself?

KV Kamath: I do not want to call or second-guess what somebody is working on. But I think it will be a budget where you try to have fiscal discipline and whatever is needed to get that discipline. Now in what measure, in what combination, is for the government to call. I think one thing that people will look for in the budget is fiscal discipline and a way to getting the deficit under control, say, over a three-year period. If it is well-constructed and well-articulated, you will see the cheer going up.

 


ET Now: Does the 4.1% number look a little tricky to you?

KV Kamath: If you eliminate waste, you eliminate what is theft and eliminate what is not needed, the 4.1 is achievable.

ET Now: When do you think fiscal and monetary policy will start working in tandem? When do you expect rates to turn?

KV Kamath: Regarding the monetary policy, we always say that let us see the constructive design of a fiscal deficit. We know what it is and where it will end. Once they see that construct as it were, for this year and, say, for two years on the line, then I should believe that they should have greater confidence to tinker with the rates, or inflation itself has to start dropping. We see several people have given several solutions starting with release food stocks, pushing the pedal on APMC reform, and so on. I am sure again this is something that the government will very quickly understand and take all the steps or some of the steps which would give policymakers confidence to get interest rates down. We should see it happen in this fiscal, in the next 12 months. I think it ought to start happening in the first six months.

ET Now: A quarter percent or more, through the course of the year?

KV Kamath: I have no call on this. Let us see what happens. Everything will depend on where the deficit number comes in and whether you are able to get the inflation rate moving down. If these turn out positive, rates could move fast.

ET Now: What is your outlook on growth in the short term, medium term, and long term?

KV Kamath: My long-term number does not have a single digit. It is two digits. So you can make a guess on it.

ET Now: During the term of this government?

KV Kamath: I think it will happen during the term of this government.

ET Now: The first term itself?

KV Kamath: It will happen in the first term of this government. That is for sure. If they progress the way they mean to, I am reasonably sure that we will see two-digit rate in the first term of this government itself.

		            We may see rapid growth over the next few years: Raamdeo AgrawalSECTIONSWe may see rapid growth over the next few years: Raamdeo AgrawalBy Narendra Nathan & Sanket Dhanorkar, ET BureauLast Updated: Jun 02, 2014, 11:53 AM ISTRate StoryShareFont SizeAbcSmallAbcMediumAbcLargeSavePrintCommentSynopsisDirectives from the Centre have to be executed at the state level. So, there are many things that are not in Modi’s hands, says Raamdeo Agrawal.ET Bureau
The central government has complete power with a clear mandate, but directives from the Centre have to be executed well at the state level. So, there are many things that are still not in Modi’s hands, says Raamdeo Agrawal, Joint Managing Director, Motilal Oswal Financial Services in an interview with Narendra Nathan and Sanket Dhanorkar.

Are we looking at a multi-year bull run?

	I think the market has not yet priced in the full potential of the economy. For the first time, a true nationalist has come to power with a clear majority. There is a new-found energy across the nation. My sense is that the market has not yet understood the difference between 300-plus seats for NDA and 272-plus seats for BJP alone. Look at how the cabinet posts have been assigned — BJP allies have got limited posts and their negotiating power is diminished. Complete power is in the hands of the government. The political scenario is drastically different now. The economy is on the cusp of a historical positive change.

	It is the same vehicle, but the driver has changed. It is now being steered by a formula-one driver. So, the acceleration will be dramatic. It will become visible very quickly. Today we are growing at 4.5 per cent. Growth is likely to pick up pace rapidly in the next few years. A lot of things will happen in five years. It will be interesting to see the index level at that time. In the process, investors will make tons of money, because the market will discount that growth two years in advance. It will not wait for the fifth year. If all domestic and global factors align, markets will go through the roof.

Are there challenges to the fragile economic recovery?

	The current optimism is because a major variable — the shambolic political setup — has been corrected. There is no doubt that the new government has been fully empowered in this election; the mandate has been given to an extremely competent individual. Right now, everybody is bullish. But one must have tempered expectations. Finally, directives from the Centre have to be executed well at the state level. Otherwise it will be a waste. There are many things that are still not in Modi’s hands.

	A lot of other factors will also play a role. Good monsoons, favourable global environment, peaceful borders, etc., can change the entire scenario. But, only time will tell how many stars will align. So, a lot will depend on external factors. I am also keenly watching how the new government tackles inflation, which is just a symptom of a much deeper problem somewhere else. The government has to address supply-side bottlenecks. A weak currency cannot make a strong country. That is why, inflation must go down. It will be the beginning of development, investments, and so on.

The rally, so far, has been driven by hope. When will fundamentals take over? 

	News headlines, and making money are two entirely different things. We should not get carried away by the headlines. The focus must be on who will actually make money. In most cases, it will be a company which is making money right now. Very rarely will a company that is broke today make money tomorrow, unless there is a complete change in business dynamics. Today, we do not have anything to go by. So, wherever there are anomalies in the economy, these will come back to normal levels. Right now, it is only about the promise of a better tomorrow. Some of these promises will have to take shape in the budget.

	 



What should be the first priority for the new government? 

	India has to become much more business friendly. Finally, the country needs to create jobs for its rising young population. Who will create these jobs? More than the government, it is the businesses which will create jobs. Businesses can create jobs only if the business environment is friendly. They also cannot sustain growth without creating jobs. So, the government has to become business friendly. All hurdles should be removed. We need businesses to take more risks as it will result in more jobs.

Will mid-cap stocks continue to perform better than large-caps for now? 

	It really depends on the company. Mid-caps were lagging for quite some time; smallcaps even more. Eventually it has to converge. Large-caps are now looking highly priced. Investor appetite is limited at these levels. Most of the action is in the low-quality, low-priced segment. Smaller investors are clearly buying low-quality stuff, thinking that the price is low. But, even if it moves into high valuation territory, low quality will remain so. This is where the entire game ends. Sure, high quality stocks are expensive now. But that doesn’t mean you should have junk in your portfolio. If you find quality at a reasonable price, buy with modest expectations. Such names are few and far between. But, even if you get 3-4 such ideas over one year, you can make money. The challenge is to have patience and hold on to the investment. Filling with junk will be a disaster, but if it works, you get a multi-bagger. Investors in high quality may underperform in a rallying market, but will emerge better off over an entire cycle.

Can we expect an earnings upgrade anytime soon? 

	A 12-15 per cent earnings upgrade is definitely possible this year. As the economy recovers, sectors, such as cement, steel and automobiles, will pick up pace. Oil & gas can also contribute to earnings growth. Right now corporate profits are contributing around 4 per cent to the GDP, which is near the bottom of the band. At the peak of a cycle, this can go upto 7-8 per cent. Assuming 13-14 per cent nominal growth in GDP, it will double in rupee term to Rs 220 trillion in next six years. Now the question is whether the current profit of Rs 4 trillion will move up to Rs 8 trillion or Rs 16 trillion. If it maintains the current ratio, it will go to Rs 8 trillion. If it touches the upper end of the band, it will go to Rs 16 trillion. If this happens and the PE multiple remains the same, the market will go up four times. Profits will zoom the moment the economy moves from 5-6 per cent to 8-9 per cent growth. That is why there is a potential for the market to go up to the stratospheric levels from here.

In August 2021, almost 15 months after the bloody clash between troops that resulted in scores of deaths, cyber groups linked with the Chinese government were reported to have been engaged in a massive cyber-espionage operation. The intent was to target seven major electricity load dispatch centres (ELDCs) near the LAC in Ladakh to disrupt power supply to the region at will. The Indian government was aware of these attacks, which included a cyber-strike to disable the country’s national emergency response systems, and took pre-emptive action to thwart these groups successfully.Published By: Arindam MukherjeePublished On: Feb 25, 2023AdvertisementAlso Watch6:01AAP, BJP councillors exchange blows again in Delhi's MCD House6:11Arvind Kejriwal, Bhagwant Mann meet Uddhav Thackeray in Mumbai2:38Would you buy these jute bag pants for Rs 60,000?16:30Amritpal Singh's aide Lovepreet Toofan released from Amritsar jail7:171 year of Russia-Ukraine war: Here are top defining imagesAdvertisementRead ThisMCD House brawl: AAP leaders reach police station to file FIR, BJP to move courtFinancial crime watchdog FATF suspends Russia's membership over Ukraine warWomen's T20 WC: South Africa script history, reach final after outclassing England BJP councillor injured in Delhi civic centre brawl, party blames AAP’s AtishiAurangabad is now Chhatrapati Sambhaji Nagar, Osmanabad is Dharashiv after Centre's nodAdvertisement

		            Our commitment for press freedom, and autonomy of public broadcast is absolute: Prakash JavadekarSECTIONSOur commitment for press freedom, and autonomy of public broadcast is absolute: Prakash JavadekarBy Nistula Hebbar, ET BureauLast Updated: May 31, 2014, 04:00 AM ISTRate StoryShareFont SizeAbcSmallAbcMediumAbcLargeSavePrintCommentSynopsis""Now there is a stage three and stage four of digitisation, we will take a call on this only after taking all things into account.""ET BureauMinister of state (independent charge) for information and broadcasting, environment and climate change Prakash Javadekar has been busy sorting out the various hats he's expected to wear in this government.  He spoke to ET on the Bharatiya Janata Party government’s approach towards media, social media, media controls and much more. Edited excerpts...  In terms of communication and messaging, the BJP’s electoral campaign has been termed an object lesson in the field. How can you translate that into the governmental structure?  	All communication needs of the government will be handled in our ministry through a social media hub. I am offering this service to all ministers. Their facebook, twitter and other social media outreach will be handled by the new media wing, and the social media and communication hub.  	The advantage that the party saw in reaching out through all communication media has been tremendous, and it was felt that the government too use the available platforms. Therefore, this new hub will provide all the help needed by various ministers and ministries for setting up and operating their facebook pages, twitter handles and the outreach throughsocial media. Traditional media is important, of course, but social media vehicles have to be spruced up.  What are your priority areas as far as this (I&B) ministry is concerned?  	We have to ensure transparency, make our vehicles more effective. We want to be accessible and accountable too. Now there is a stage three and stage four of digitisation, we will take a call on this only after taking all things into account. The issue is that digitisation increases the revenue of paid channels, but customers want fewer advertisements.  	Now 11 crore new settop boxes are required, which provides a great case for indigenisation, rather than just import them. I will take it up with the finance and commerce ministers on how this could be done.  During the elections, an interview of Prime Minister Narendra Modi set off questions on the autonomy of the public broadcaster. As I&B minister, how will you deal with it?  	Right off the bat, I would like to say that our commitment for press freedom, and the autonomy of public broadcast is absolute. But freedom or autonomy has its own responsibilities.  	Media has the responsibility of being neutral and objective. There's always a concern that when the government is spending so much, it must reach the public. The public broadcaster is a tool for public awareness. Having said all of this, let me categorically state that we have no plans to enforce controls on the media.  Modi has been described as a “post TV” Prime Minister, in that he reaches out to his audience or voter directly. How would you recast the role of the traditional media?  This is a lesson for everyone on how to put your point across, in the way the Prime Minister does. Minister for law and communications Ravi Shankar Prasad and I have been deputed as spokespersons for the government and we will shortly come up with a communications plan to suit everyone's needs. This government is different from the way it approaches issues and problems.  	For instance, Modiji’s design for the Cabinet. Yesterday, there were some issues related to environment and power. Piyush Goel holds the power, coal and renewable energy portfolio, I hold the environment portfolio, and between the two of us and 10 officials we sorted things which the previous government had tied up in knots in a Group of Ministers (GoM) set up. The emphasis is on synergy. For the media too, there will be things to learn from the new government and its functioning. Don’t miss out on ET Prime stories!

Countries spying on each other, governments spying on their citizens, political parties spying on each other and companies spying for industrial secrets. However, with the advent of technology, especially the internet, it is less dependent on human intelligence and more on technical intelligence. Now that we are all so interconnected through our various devices, we are vulnerable to the invasion of our private spaces. Even innocent-looking devices like Alexa know more about you than you ever know. However, the latest public reckoning of spying, which has stirred the government into vigilance, has come from elsewhere.Late in January, a Chinese ‘weather balloon’ spotted high over American skies—borne along by high winds all the way from Alaska to South Carolina, at an incredible 60,000 feet—provoked US President Joe Biden to shoot it down. But the object presently spooking India’s strategic experts is much closer at hand: the innocuous-looking closed-circuit television camera, or CCTV, the sort that peers at you in an elevator or an ATM kiosk.advertisementMost CCTVs in the world are of Chinese origin. The leading global suppliers are Hikvision and Dahua, two firms partly owned by the Chinese government. Concerns that these could be sneaky espionage tools had prompted an alarmed Washington to push back against Beijing’s creeping spy games. The US banned Hikvision, Dahua and Huawei equipment from use in government and critical infrastructure installations in 2019. Last year, the UK followed suit; Australia joined the list last fortnight. The Chinese whispers reached India too after the clash in the icy heights, and we have woken to the fact that CCTV cameras of Chinese make dominate our market—accounting for up to 80 per cent of domestic applications and over 98 per cent of government installations, including military compounds.India’s strategic establishment, long trained to think in terrestrial terms, may have been slow to wake up to the way the war has been scaled up to a more rarefied level. The threat is not limited to the icy heights of Galwan or Yangtse. The intrusion may be less obvious than boots on the ground, and more abstract than 38,000 sq. km of territory. But the Chinese eye on us is omnipresent, rendered even more inscrutable by the miniaturising magic of the digital age. If the alarmist version of the story is taken at face value, it’s not just one eye but all of two million eyes, watching us everywhere, from mundane street corners to high-value defence installations.About a million stand unblinkingly in government institutions, another million cover India’s civic life. Count everything from private bungalows to the 150,000 CCTV cameras on Delhi’s streets, to those used on the Delhi Metro or by the SPG, right up to highly sensitive defence sites via Bharat Electronics Limited and DRDO clientship. And as Senior Editor Pradip R. Sagar’s cover story this week reveals, an internal note of the Ministry of Defence (MoD) in May 2021 noted grimly that surveillance cameras of Chinese make were installed in all Indian naval establishments.CCTVs seem to have escaped global strategic attention earlier because of their purportedly innocent nature. The very term ‘clo­sed-circuit television camera’ conjures up a simplistic vision: an all-seeing eye that never sleeps but the data generated by it flowing only within a tight, restricted loop. What if the circuit were not as closed as everyone imagined? Increasingly, a CCTV is more than just a camera wired to a local area network. Today’s Video Surveillance Systems often rely on centrally controlled Network Video Recorders (NVR) for storage, and these work with Internet Protocol cameras, not the old analog ones. Besides offering technically advanced features like higher definition, varifocal or pan-tilt-zoom imaging and onboard video analytics, IP cameras are—as the name suggests—networked devices. They are made to receive control data and send visual data. Specifically, they come embedded with a sophisticated integrated circuit called a System-on-Chip (SoC). Again, as the name tells you, this is a whole system—a powerful assembly of functions like the CPU, graphics processor, memory and, more crucially, WiFi or cellular radio modems—all crunched into a chip that can be as small as a shirt button. Modem connectivity means its capabilities can be switched on remotely.advertisementA curious name in the global SoC market is HiSilicon, wholly owned by Huawei, the company that gained notoriety amidst allegations that it served as a cat’s paw for Chinese espionage. This led to it being banned from several 5G markets, including India. Established only in 2004, heavy R&D investment propelled HiSilicon to the top of the global game—it found its way even into US-made Honeywell cameras—before a 2020 export control order by the US saw it debarred from access to American chip design software and Taiwan-based “foundries”. But a silently ticking HiSilicon chip is in our midst everywhere. Experts had been warning of the spectre of Chinese cyber-snooping in all its forms for well over a decade. But this micro-device has only just been crowned as a likely protagonist in the belated bout of alarm that presently has New Delhi in its grip, with genuine fears about the suspected flow of sensitive military data to Beijing. “You don’t need to send spies across the border anymore—these CCTVs become the eyes of any country wanting to do mischief,” Lt Gen. Rajesh Pant (retd), the National Cyber Security Coordinator for India’s National Security Council, told our team doing the cover story. “They are the best tools for techint [technical intelligence]. The unchecked proliferation of such devices across our country is a serious security risk.”advertisementOf course, two million CCTVs cannot be suddenly thrown into the Arabian Sea without throwing our systems totally awry, so what can be a solution? A three-pronged way lies ahead of India. To begin with, a scaling back has begun. The Southern Naval Command is phasing out Hikvision CCTVs. We also need legal barriers against digital spies sneaking in through the backdoor via ‘Made in India’ partnerships. Simultaneously, cyber experts are combating technology on its own turf, firstly by reprogramming Chinese chips with Indian software. Till such time as India can manufacture its own high-quality CCTVs, testing systems must be installed that can trace the presence of sneaky micro-devices in any foreign equipment, whether of Chinese make or otherwise. Espionage is still all cloak-and-dagger drama, but more with chips and net.--- ENDS ---

		            There is a leadership vacuum in Infosys, time to get Nandan Nilekani back: Mohandas PaiSECTIONSThere is a leadership vacuum in Infosys, time to get Nandan Nilekani back: Mohandas PaiLast Updated: May 29, 2014, 12:55 PM ISTRate StoryShareFont SizeAbcSmallAbcMediumAbcLargeSavePrintCommentSynopsis""There is a leadership vacuum in the company, because they made the wrong choice of CEO three years ago and that is playing out right now.""ET Now ET Now caught up with former Infosys Board Member Mohandas Pai for his views on the top level exits in Infosys. Excerpts:  ET Now: There are two ways of looking at it the top level exits in Infosys. On the one hand, a lot of people say that there was a team that was probably not performing well and now they are exiting and that will probably be a positive for the stock over the long run. The sceptics, on the other hand, would argue that there are a lot of people who have been manning the company for the last many years and it is not a pint-sized company, but a Rs 1 lakh 70 thousand crore behemoth. Why have there been so many high profile exits in the company?  Mohandas Pai: There is a leadership vacuum in the company, because they made the wrong choice of CEO three years ago and that is playing out right now. The company has not performed and in June 2011, they had appointed three members on the board and all three of them have gone now and all three have been extraordinary individuals.  Ashok Vemuri is now the CEO of another company, V Balakrishnan had left and has started his own fund and BG Srinivas, I am told, would now be joining some other company as CEO.  So obviously, all three have been CEO materials. It is obvious that the chemistry did not work, or they were not fully empowered. There is a need for the board to sit down and work out a good succession plan and put a new team in place because the entire layer of people below the executive board are now gone and many of them were outstanding performers.  	Yes, a few of them possibly were not pulling the weight, but it is not possible that all of them were not doing so. They were extraordinary people and they are performing at other places.  	So there is a need for teamwork and need for people to come together. They need to forget the past and focus on the future, they need to realign the company based upon what the market needs.  	The market has changed and so its model needs to change, its management structure needs to change and the set of people who have ruled the company for 30 years have to step down and hand over reins, because they have stayed on for too long. Therefore, I hope that in the next one or two months, the board will come together along with NRN and once and for all close this issue.  ET Now: Where can the breakthrough come from at this point, because you have already stated in the past that the board and Mr Murthy need to take responsibility for the exits. It just seems that the series of exits is not ending. Does this mean that the company may have to also consider forming a completely new team from outside and hiring some expensive resources from outside?  Mohandas Pai: My view is that the layer below BG Srinivas, V Balakrishnan and Ashok Vemuri is an extraordinary layer. You have many good people who have run units. But they have run units and they require one or two years to come up with enterprise.  Enterprise position is very different from a unit position. You could be an extraordinary unit person, but to run an entire enterprise in a very competitive environment, you require some mentoring and some experience.  	Now the entire generation of leaders who could have handled enterprise has gone. The next layer of people have done very well and there is great management there, but they need to connect between themselves and NRN who is the executive chairman and will stay for the next three years. That connect has to be fixed and it is up to NRN to do it.  	Now it can be done by somebody stepping up to the plate as CEO. He will be inexperienced, he would not have handled enterprise, but being very efficient, in three to six months, he can pick it up.  	However, that requires a different style of functioning by NRN. It also means that some amount of bloodletting will happen. In fact, it has to happen when the next generation comes up, because obviously people who are much senior will not stay on and there has to be a cleanup. So in the next two or three months, we have to see a radical change.  	It is very difficult to speculate whether we will have an external team of people coming in, because such a team does not exist in any other company, let us remember. It is a very large company, with 160000 people, and $25 billion or $30 billion of market value.  So it requires a certain level of expertise and the board and the chairman have to work with them very carefully. So they have their task cut out and it will help if Nandan Nilekani is asked to come back, because he could provide the link between the chairman and the next layer of people and help to mentor them for the next couple of years, because he had an extraordinarily connect with people, his style is very inclusive and he is a person who empowers his team and gives them full strength to go ahead and stands by them. So getting Nilekani back would be a great strategy. Don’t miss out on ET Prime stories!

MahajanNew Delhi,ISSUE DATE: Mar 6, 2023  | UPDATED: Feb 25, 2023 04:17 ISTPM Narendra Modi with BJP president J.P. Nadda at a party meet; (Photo: Chandradeep Kumar)The events of the past few weeks have been a testing time for the country’s ruling party, what with the crony capitalism charges against the Adanis and a damning BBC documentary on the 2002 Gujarat riots. But, as always, the fightback has been led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself, starting off with his speeches in both houses of Parliament during the motion of thanks to the President’s address. Political analysts have focused on one line from it—“Desh dekh raha hai, ek akela kitnon pe bhari padh raha hai (The country is watching how one man alone has taken on so many)”—to get a sense of the course the PM’s party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, is likely to take in the run-up to the 2024 general election. The vaunted BJP poll machine is a feat in itself, but they believe it’ll finally boil down to how well the party can sell the ‘Modi vs the Others’ narrative if it is to get a third consecutive term in power.

What explains their resilience?AdvertisementMG ArunMumbai,ISSUE DATE: Mar 6, 2023  | UPDATED: Feb 24, 2023 18:46 ISTPeople walk past the BSE building in Mumbai on January 27; (Photo: AP)On January 24, US-based short-seller Hindenburg Research set off a minor earthquake when it published a scathing report on one of India’s largest business groups, helmed by a businessman steadily climbing the world’s richest lists, the Ahmedabad-based Gautam Adani. Among its many accusations were manipulation of group companies stocks via shell firms in tax havens and accounting lapses. Coming shortly before Adani Enterprises’ planned launch of a follow-on public offer, the revelations triggered panic selling of the shares of the nine listed group companies, sending their prices crashing on the Indian bourses. It not only eroded as much as $120 billion (nearly Rs 10 lakh crore) in investor wealth but also half the market capitalisation of the companies in a matter of just a week. Although robust quarterly results of group firms and pre-payment of over $1 billion (nearly Rs 8,280 crore) to release pledged shares in three group firms—Adani Ports & Special Economic Zone (APSEZ), Adani Green Energy and Adani Transmission—helped the group arrest the overall slide, the share prices of some of the companies continued to go downhill.Published By: Arindam MukherjeePublished On: Feb 24, 2023AdvertisementAlso Watch16:30Amritpal Singh's aide Lovepreet Toofan released from Amritsar jail7:171 year of Russia-Ukraine war: Here are top defining images5:15Arrest me if you can: Khalistani separatist Amritpal Singh in police station, challenges SSP on camera | Exclusive3:53Caught on cam: Rajasthan man shot at, beaten up in broad daylight outside gym in Bharatpur1:27Yuvraj Singh signs up for 'Kun Faya Kun' trend on Instagram, what is it?AdvertisementRead ThisPunjab cops didn’t act against Amritpal Singh supporters to avoid sacrilege, says AAP MLA0:22Why is a man caught in cage for leopard?

		            $3 billion in 10 days! 3 reasons why FIIs are buying Indian stocks non-stopSECTIONS$3 billion in 10 days! 3 reasons why FIIs are buying Indian stocks non-stopBy Nikhil Agarwal, ETMarkets.comLast Updated: Nov 09, 2022, 10:50 AM ISTRate StoryShareFont SizeAbcSmallAbcMediumAbcLargeSavePrintCommentSynopsisDespite a number of hits and misses, the quarterly earnings season is displaying inherent strength of the Indian economy amid fears of a global recession. Aided by impressive credit growth, improving asset quality and rising margins, the Q2 numbers of banks have been encouraging while IT results have been on expected lines with decent growth.ETMarkets.comNEW DELHI: Despite the 75 bps rate hike by the US Federal Reserve earlier this month and not-so-cheap valuations on Dalal Street, foreign institutional investors or FIIs have been buying Indian stocks as if there is no tomorrow. FIIs have been net buyers in all the last 10 trading sessions and have cumulatively accumulated equities worth over $3 billion in the period.NSDL data shows that the net investment by FIIs since October 21 has been to the tune of Rs 24,899.59 crore (over $3 billion). The highest buying was seen two days ahead of the outcome of the US Fed meet on November 2 and continued non-stop even after Powell's hawkish comments signalled that interest rates will rise higher than previously expected. Interestingly, domestic institutional investors or DIIs have been busy booking profits during the period. In the last 10 sessions, DIIs have been net buyers on only one occasion and have altogether sold stocks worth Rs 6,779.93 crore.In the calendar year 2022, FIIs have been net buyers in only two months of July (Rs 4,989 crore) and August (Rs 51,204 crore). The total selloff on a year-to-date basis has been more than Rs 151,900 crore.So what's making FIIs buy truckloads of Indian stocks? Here are 3 major reasons:1) FOMOWith robust domestic flows holding the market up, Dalal Street has been an oasis of peace amid the turmoil in global markets seen in 2022. Even as the Dow Jones is down over 9% so far in the calendar year, Nifty is up over 5% and is staring at all-time high levels.""The Indian market has been stubborn and has refused to go down despite rising rates. This is causing serious FOMO among global investors. Once Nifty crosses its all-time high, the FOMO factor will increase,"" said Rishiraj Maheshwari, founder of RISCH Wealth and Family Office.2) EarningsDespite a number of hits and misses, the quarterly earnings season is displaying inherent strength of the Indian economy amid fears of a global recession. Aided by impressive credit growth, improving asset quality and rising margins, the Q2 numbers of banks have been encouraging while IT results have been on expected lines with decent growth.""Expect decent flow going forward as the growth story of India is intact. Better than expected earnings and comfortable macro numbers are positive for India compared to other emerging markets,"" said K Dileep, Head of PMS at Geojit Financial Services.3) Stronger rupeeWith the cooling off of the US dollar index from the peak near the 115-level to the sub-110 range, the Indian rupee is also gaining strength. The domestic currency hit a one-month high of 81.39 against the American currency today, after having slipped to a record low of 83.32 last month.A large part of the FII outflow earlier was attributed to currency depreciation. ""The dip in the dollar index below 110 will nudge FIIs to buy more. Nifty is likely to face a significant correction only after crossing the all-time high of 18,604,"" said Dr V K Vijayakumar of Geojit Financial Services.Forex watchers expect the rupee to trade with a positive bias on the rise in risk appetite in global markets and a weak dollar.(With data inputs from Ritesh Presswala)(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

But it has not discouraged a revolt in the opposition-ruled states. Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot of the Congress was the first to withdraw from the NPS in March 2022, shifting state employees to the OPS (now called OPS-2) retrospectively from the day of their joining the government job. Indeed, in his budget speech on February 10 this year, Gehlot extended the OPS to staff of state-run universities and public sector undertakings.Published By: Arindam MukherjeePublished On: Feb 24, 2023AdvertisementAlso Watch6:01AAP, BJP councillors exchange blows again in Delhi's MCD House6:11Arvind Kejriwal, Bhagwant Mann meet Uddhav Thackeray in Mumbai2:38Would you buy these jute bag pants for Rs 60,000?16:30Amritpal Singh's aide Lovepreet Toofan released from Amritsar jail7:171 year of Russia-Ukraine war: Here are top defining imagesAdvertisementRead ThisMCD House brawl: AAP leaders reach police station to file FIR, BJP to move courtFinancial crime watchdog FATF suspends Russia's membership over Ukraine warWomen's T20 WC: South Africa script history, reach final after outclassing England BJP councillor injured in Delhi civic centre brawl, party blames AAP’s AtishiAurangabad is now Chhatrapati Sambhaji Nagar, Osmanabad is Dharashiv after Centre's nodAdvertisement

		            A bitter pill! Gland Pharma records biggest fall since listing, hits 52-week lowSECTIONSA bitter pill! Gland Pharma records biggest fall since listing, hits 52-week lowBy Pawan Nahar, ETMarkets.comLast Updated: Oct 27, 2022, 02:35 PM ISTRate StoryShareFont SizeAbcSmallAbcMediumAbcLargeSavePrintCommentSynopsisAnother domestic brokerage firm Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities has cut its revenue and EBITDA estimates for the next three fiscals due to near-term slowdown in growth, owing to cost inflation and volume decline in the US.AgenciesNew Delhi: Shares of Gland Pharma dropped 15% during the trading session on Thursday, registering its biggest intra-day loss in more than two years of listing at the bourses following a disappointing Q2 performance.The drug maker, which announced its results for the September 2022 quarter, reported a 20% year-on-year (YoY) decline in consolidated net profit at Rs 241.24 crore for the quarter on lower sales and higher expenses.Following the announcement of earnings, shares of Gland Pharma plunged 15% to Rs 1,891, its new 52-week low, before trading at Rs 1,901 at 12:50 pm. The scrip had settled at Rs 2,224 on Tuesday.Global brokerage firm Jefferies downgraded Gland Pharma to hold from a buy with a revised target price of Rs 2,241, given the near-term topline growth and margin headwinds.The consolidated revenue from operations during the period under review was at Rs 1,044.4 crore, as against Rs 1,080.47 crore in the year-ago period, the company's regulatory filing added.Gland Pharma said revenue from its core markets i.e. US, Europe, Canada and Australia grew by 3% to Rs 747.5 crore in the second quarter, as against Rs 722.5 crore in the corresponding period last fiscal.However, its India revenue was down 42% at Rs 72.6 crore, as compared to Rs 125.8 crore in the year-ago quarter, while the same for the 'rest of the world' market was also down 3% at Rs 224.3 crore, as against Rs 232.2 crore.Kotak Institutional Equities said that Gland’s sequential sales recovery was lower than estimated in 2QFY23, while margins fell to new lows, resulting in a PAT miss. The company has retracted its FY2023 sales and margin guidance with low visibility on timelines to normalcy.""Owing to continued challenges on multiple fronts, we expect Gland’s growth and margins to reset downward to a new normal,"" it said and maintained a 'reduce' rating on the stock with a new target price of Rs 1,975 from Rs 2,325 earlier.Another domestic brokerage firm Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities has cut its revenue and EBITDA estimates for the next three fiscals due to near-term slowdown in growth, owing to cost inflation and volume decline in the US.Margins are likely to remain under pressure in the near term due to cost inflation and negative operational leverage, it added. The stock has corrected sharply, factoring in all near-term concerns, it said, with a buy rating and a target price of Rs 2,582.""We are not positive about the US generics market, we like Gland Pharma because of its presence in the low competition injectable segment, ability to build economies of scale with a partnership model and a strong compliance track record,"" it added.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views, and opinions given by the experts are their own.

		            Depreciating rupee giving new life to IT stocks. Will this happiness last?SECTIONSDepreciating rupee giving new life to IT stocks. Will this happiness last?By Nikhil Agarwal, ETMarkets.comLast Updated: Sep 27, 2022, 02:47 PM ISTRate StoryShareFont SizeAbcSmallAbcMediumAbcLargeSavePrintCommentSynopsisAnalysts have cautioned that economic slowdown and a recession looming in the US and Europe will hit the margins of India’s software exporters hard. But the sharp depreciation in the rupee is now acting as a tailwind for the sector.iStockNotwithstanding the rupee’s plunge to historic lows against the dollar, IT stock investors have apparently ignored all the worries related to margin compression and demand moderation.IT has been the worst performer so far in 2022 with the Nifty IT index having lost around 31% of its value against Nifty's 2% loss during the period. However, when the Nifty eroded around 1.8% of its value on Monday, the index was the only beacon of hope in a sea of red.Analysts have cautioned that economic slowdown and a recession looming in the US and Europe will hit the margins of India’s software exporters hard. But the sharp depreciation in the rupee is now acting as a tailwind for the sector.IT majors like TCS, Infosys, HCL Technologies, Wipro, Tech Mahindra and Mindtree that earn a bulk of their revenues in dollar terms are likely to benefit from a weakening rupee. The domestic currency touched a record low of 81.65 on Monday against the safe-haven dollar.Analysts are of the view that the price mostly factors in the global recession and IT stocks are now trading at reasonable valuations.On a year-to-date (YTD) basis, Wipro, Coforge and Tech Mahindra are down about 42-45%. TCS has lost around 20% of its market value, Infosys and HCL 27% and 31%, respectively.Hiren Ved, CEO, Alchemy Capital Management, said IT stocks underperformed on fears of lower tech spending due to recession in developed markets like the US and the EU. “As long as the multi-year cycle of increased outsourcing and higher spends on specialised IT services firms remain intact, we will continue to invest in IT,” he said.The current momentum in IT stocks may, however, prove to be short-lived for those tapping the sector to earn a quick buck even as the long-term growth story remains intact.Sandeep Bhardwaj, CEO, IIFL Securities, said a slowdown or recession would adversely affect India’s exports as demand for goods and services would begin to dry up. “Hence, for the medium term, we should expect higher volatility in IT stocks,” he said.Global brokerage firm Jefferies has stated that Accenture’s quarterly revenue growth of 22% YoY suggests strong growth for Indian IT firms in Q2. “Its FY23 organic growth guidance of 5.5-8.5% YoYcc, is below our 14%/8% YoYcc growth expectation for Indian IT firms for FY23/FY24E, which could pose risk to our FY24 estimates. With sector valuations still at a 10% premium to 10-year average levels, we remain selective, with Infosys our only pick in the sector,” it said.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views, and opinions given by the experts are their own.

		            Will Nifty50 hit 18,000 this week? 9 short-term trading ideas that could give 5-10% returnSECTIONSWill Nifty50 hit 18,000 this week? 9 short-term trading ideas that could give 5-10% returnBy Kshitij Anand, ETMarkets.comLast Updated: Sep 12, 2022, 10:03 AM ISTRate StoryShareFont SizeAbcSmallAbcMediumAbcLargeSavePrintCommentSynopsisAfter consolidating in a range for more than 3 months, Raymond has finally managed to confirm a breakout above the Rs 1,015 mark. The price action was supported by enough volumes, and we all witnessed a major breakout in daily RSI (14). Thus, we advise traders to buy the stock near Rs 1,020 for the target of Rs 1,100 in the coming sessions.AgenciesThe Nifty50 rallied 1.7 per cent in the week gone by to close above 17,800 levels and is just a per cent away from the 18,000 mark which most experts feel is achievable amid strong foreign flows and positive global cues.Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have poured in nearly Rs 4,000 crore so far in the month of September 2022 in the cash segment of the Indian equity markets. They have been net buyers in 4 out of 7 sessions so far this month.After a strong close above crucial resistance placed at 17,800, all eyes are on 18,000 which could lead to some profit booking, suggest experts.“Technically, for the Nifty, 17,800-18,000 could be the struggling zone wherein we could witness profit booking due to global uncertainty,” Mehul Kothari – AVP – Technical Research, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers, said.“At the 18,000 zone we are witnessing a trend line resistance and we have a huge built up in 18,000 CE option (weekly series). With regards to the index, we advise traders for fresh long only above 18,000 mark and that too on a closing basis,” he said. A close above 18,000 could take it towards the 18,150 – 18,250 mark.We have collated a list of trading ideas from different experts which could give a 5-10% return in the next 3-4 weeks:Expert | Mehul Kothari – AVP – Technical Research, Anand Rathi Shares & Stock BrokersMetropolis Healthcare: Buy near Rs 1,480 | LTP: Rs 1,484 | Target: Rs 1,620 | Stop Loss Rs 1,410 | Upside nearly 10%Like other diagnostic stocks, even Metropolis was under corrective mode for many months. In recent sessions, the stock has confirmed a higher top formation on a daily scale. We are witnessing a double bottom formation and that indicates the formation of the bottom. Thus, we advise traders to buy the stock near Rs 1,480 for the target of Rs 1,620 in the coming sessions.Raymond: Buy near Rs 1,020 | LTP: Rs 1,034 | Target Rs 1,100 | Stop Loss: Rs 980 | Upside 8%After consolidating in a range for more than 3 months, Raymond has finally managed to confirm a breakout above the Rs 1,015 mark. The price action was supported by enough volumes, and we all witnessed a major breakout in daily RSI (14). Thus, we advise traders to buy the stock near Rs 1,020 for the target of Rs 1,100 in the coming sessions.Dhanuka Agritech: Buy near Rs 710 | LTP: Rs 724 | Target: Rs 770 | Stop Loss: Rs 680 | Upside 8%Since November 2021, Dhanuka has been trading sideways to slightly negative. However, the stock has broken out of the range as per price action. The price action resembles a descending triangle breakout and that could trigger a faster upside. Along with the breakout, the counter has managed to close back above its 200-Day exponential and simple moving average. Thus, we advise traders to buy the stock near Rs 710 for the target of Rs 770 in the coming sessions.Expert | Om Mehra, Technical Associate, Choice BrokingUPL: Buy | LTP: Rs 741 | Target: Rs 820 | Stop Loss: Rs 720 | Upside 10%On the monthly chart, the stock has been trading with the support of a lower band of Bollinger which suggests a positive bias. Additionally, the stock has formed a strong base around Rs 720 level while Rs 760 will be a resistance level, crossing above the same can show more upside rally. On the daily chart, the stock has given a breakout of falling trendline and consolidating near the resistance zone which points out strength in the counter. As per the above technical parameters, the stock is looking bullish on charts. Crossing above Rs 760 can show more strength in the counter for a target of Rs 820-860 levels. While on the downside, the support is at Rs 720 level.Pidilite Industries: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,844 | Target: Rs 3,000| Stop Loss: Rs 2,720 | Upside 5%On the weekly chart, the stock has given a breakout of resistance i.e. Rs 2,775, which suggests upside movement in the counter. The stock is trading above its 21-simple moving averages, confirming the support in price action. Moreover, it has given a breakout of cup and handle formation on the daily chart. RSI plotted on the daily and the weekly timeframe is above 50 levels, which reflects the strong momentum in the stock. Hence, based on the above technical structure one can initiate a long position at Rs 2,845.Closing and sustaining above Rs 2,900 will lead towards Rs 3,000-3,060 levels in the coming days. Stop loss can be kept as Rs 2,720.Apollo Hospital: Buy | LTP: Rs 4,460 | Target: Rs 4,700| Stop Loss: Rs 4,200| Upside 5%On the weekly chart, the stock has been trading with a higher high & higher low formation for the last 3 weeks which suggests continued strength upside. On the daily chart, the price has been trading above the upper leg of “Bollinger Band” which suggests a bullish rally will continue further in the near term. As per the above technical parameters, the stock is looking bullish on the chart. One can buy the stock at Rs 4,460, and a fall to Rs 4,430 is a good buying opportunity for a target of Rs 4,700-4,900 levels while on the downside, the support comes at Rs 4,200.Expert | Nooresh Merani, www.nooreshtech.co.in to ETNowSBI: Buy | LTP: Rs 553 | Target: Rs 590 | Stop Loss: Rs 540 | Upside 6%We have seen a new 52-week high on SBI that looks set for further momentum given that we have already moved up quite a bit across the board. Short-term traders can put a strict stop loss at Rs 540 and a target price of Rs 590.HDFC Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,498| Target: Rs 1,600| Stop Loss: Rs 1,475 | Upside 6.8%HDFC Bank is yet to catch up with the whole banking rally. The stock is trying to make that breakout move of Rs 1,500 if it does so it could go towards Rs 1,600 strict stop loss at Rs 1,475.Expert | Kunal Bothra, kunalbothra.co.in to ETNowNCC: Buy | LTP: Rs 74.75 | Target: Rs 80 | Stop Loss: Rs 70 | Upside 7%NCC has also been one of my picks over the last week. I remain bullish on the stock and expect this to be a big turnaround move. The targets remain at Rs 80 for NCC, and stop loss at Rs 70.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views, and opinions given by the experts are their own.

MUMBAI: Alfa Laval (India), a subsidiary of Sweden-based Alfa Laval Corporate AB, today said its parent firm has raised the delisting offer price to Rs 2,850 a share.In a filing with the BSE, Alfa Laval India said its parent company increased the delisting offer price after ""considering the prevailing market conditions and with a view to reward shareholders"".However, the company further said, ""Offer price should in no way be construed as a ceiling or maximum price for the purpose of the reverse book-building process and the public shareholders are free to tender their equity shares at any price higher than the indicative offer price.""Reacting to the news, the company's shares surged by 14.40 per cent to close at Rs 2,710.85 a piece on the BSE. In the intra-day trade, the stock hit a 52-week high of Rs 2,742.The entity that offers heat transfer, separation and fluid handling technologies would be delisted from the BSE and the National Stock Exchange.In September 2011, the company's board had accepted the delisting proposal and in October fixed a floor price of Rs 2,045 a share to buy out the outstanding public float.Alfa Laval (India) had said the promoter firm would make a delisting offer to acquire up to 2,040,202 shares, accounting for 11.23 per cent stake in the domestic entity.At present, the promoter company holds 88.77 per cent stake in Alfa Laval (India).Don’t miss out on ET Prime stories!

		            DB Realty, Unitech stocks rose after top executives granted bail in 2G scamSECTIONSDB Realty, Unitech stocks rose after top executives granted bail in 2G scamBy Kiran Kabtta Somvanshi, ET BureauLast Updated: Nov 30, 2011, 04:02 AM ISTRate StoryShareFont SizeAbcSmallAbcMediumAbcLargeSavePrintCommentSynopsisThe stocks of DB Realty and Unitech rose after top executives of these companies were granted bail in the 2G scam case. The stocks of DB Realty and Unitech rose after top executives of these companies were granted bail in the 2G scam case. The DB Realty stock has risen 40%, while Unitech gained 4%. However, some of the intrinsic problems which plague these companies, and uncertainty over the outcome of the 2G scam case may prevent any major appreciation in the stock.Scrapping of projects involving the government, delayed execution and difficulty in securing approvals for new projects – DB Realty has seen it all. The company did not launch any new projects in the September quarter and sold around 50-75% of its existing seven projects. Even the analyst community has washed its hands of the stock with most brokerages discontinuing their coverage on the stock.The company’s net sales for the first half year ended September are down by 36%, while its net profit dropped by 76% during the same period. However, the company is extinguishing its debt by selling non-core assets.At the end of the September quarter, the company managed to reduce its debt from Rs600 crore a year ago to Rs 230 crore. It is sitting on a substantial pileup of TDR (transfer of development rights), which can be realised to further boost cash flows of the company. However, the outcome of the 2G scam case on its promoters will weigh heavily on the business prospects of the company which has its projects predominantly in Mumbai.Unitech is the second big real estate company to be impacted because of the alleged involvement of its top deck in the 2G scam. Besides the problems associated with all real estate companies, there are other challenges.For instance, the company was at the receiving end of shareholders’ ire at its annual general meeting as they refused to approve a resolution to pay dividend on equity shares for the fiscal 2011. The company’s net sales and earnings have dropped by 17% and 45% respectively for the first half of this fiscal.However, the business model continues to remain strong. Unitech has a presence in the affordable and mid-income housing segment which enables it to generate cash flows. It has been launching new projects, although the scale of execution is slow. Despite lower revenue recognition, it has managed to lower its debt through internal cash accruals.It has an outstanding net debt of Rs 5,144 crore and a land bank of close to 7,000 acres with an average cost of acquisition of land of around Rs 250 per square feet. Despite strong fundamentals, the loss of credibility and uncertainty over the 2G probe will restrict any major upside in the stock. The stock continues to trade at a significant discount to its land value that analysts estimate to be at Rs 60.Don’t miss out on ET Prime stories!

NEW DELHI: The poor financial health of state electricity boards could pose significant business risks for power traders in the country, says rating agency Fitch.In a report released today, Fitch Ratings said the credit risk of power traders has become ""riskier"" due to profitability and liquidity constraints faced by state power utilities.""If these utilities are having liquidity problems which are leading to delays or defaults in their obligation to power traders, then this in turn increases the business risk for power traders,"" it noted.This could lead investors in power trading companies to either seek higher return on the investments or seek alternate avenues for investment.Leading power traders include PTC India and Tata Power Trading Company.Going by estimates, over the past four years, the top five trading licensees have controlled over 80 per cent of the market in terms of volumes.Some of the large loss making state power utilities come from the states for Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh. These are also largest buyers of short-term electricity through power traders, Fitch Ratings said.""The financial health of state power utilities, the major customers of power traders, has deteriorated with aggregate annual book losses widening to Rs 295 billion (Rs 29,500 crore) in FY 10 from Rs 70 billion (Rs 7,000 crore) in FY 06, leading to an increase in counterparty risk,"" the report said.As per Planning Commission's estimates, electricity distribution losses totalled a whopping Rs 70,000 crore in 2010-11.According to Fitch, the biggest short-term buyers -- SPUs in Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan -- face huge energy deficits with largest cash losses on a revenue and subsidy-realised basis.""Hence, these states will remain net-buyers on short-term power markets and continue to act as major counterparties for power traders. This increases the risk for undiversified power traders significantly,"" it added.The report pointed out that traders with strong equity base and high cash balance are better placed since they have the buffer to absorb any increase in the working capital cycle in the event of delays or defaults by SPUs.Director in Fitch's Asia Pacific Utilities team Salil Garg said the agency expects larger traders to face low business risk due to many factors, including economies of scale and diversified customer base.Don’t miss out on ET Prime stories!

		            Cigarette companies: Price hikes with higher volumes hold promiseSECTIONSCigarette companies: Price hikes with higher volumes hold promiseBy Kiran Kabtta Somvanshi, ET BureauLast Updated: Jul 19, 2011, 04:24 AM ISTRate StoryShareFont SizeAbcSmallAbcMediumAbcLargeSavePrintCommentSynopsisShares of cigarette companies have rallied over the past one month, with ITC, Godfrey Philips and VST Industries hitting record highs. Shares of cigarette companies have rallied over the past one month, with the three leading cigarette makers ITC, Godfrey Philips and VST Industries hitting record highs. All the three stocks have posted robust returns in the past one year, significantly outperforming the benchmark Sensex, helped by favourable taxation and increase in cost of competing tobacco products. Unlike previous years, the central government has not increased excise duty on cigarettes in the budget for this fiscal, though states have varyingly raised value added tax (VAT). While northern states such as Rajasthan have significantly raised VAT on cigarettes, all the southern states have spared the sector from a major increase. In contrast, competing tobacco products such as ‘pan masala’ and chewing tobacco have witnessed cost increases in the form of higher taxation and a rise in raw material cost. Also, prices of tobacco have remained benign compared with higher prices of ‘tendu’ leaves that are used for manufacturing ‘beedis’. The cigarette industry has cashed in on the rise in beedi prices by competitively pricing low-end and micro filter cigarettes to lure ‘beedi’ smokers to cheaper cigarettes. Also, contrary to its earlier plans the government decided to issue less gory pictorial warnings on cigarette packets, which has aided sentiment in the stocks. In the quarter ended June, VST Industries reported a 90% year-on-year jump in net profit. ITC, which is yet to declare its first quarter earnings, is expected to have witnessed a pick-up in cigarette volumes despite price increases in some of its products. Going forward, the rally in cigarette companies is likely to continue as all factors seem to be positive for the sector. Analysts expect cigarette companies to report strong earnings growth driven by higher volumes, price increases and lower expenses.Don’t miss out on ET Prime stories!

		            Lovable Lingerie's dream run on as traders lap it upSECTIONSLovable Lingerie's dream run on as traders lap it upOUR BUREAULast Updated: Jun 18, 2011, 12:33 AM ISTRate StoryShareFont SizeAbcSmallAbcMediumAbcLargeSavePrintCommentSynopsisLovable Lingerie is 3rd-best performing stock among companies listed this year, with it doubling in value, as traders bet it could repeat performance of Page Indus.MUMBAI: Lovable Lingerie is the third-best performing stock among companies listed this year, with it doubling in value, as traders bet it could repeat the performance of Page Industries, sellers of Jockey innerwear. It gained a third in about a week. But the small float and low delivery volumes is an alert against wagering on it for some who fear it may have risen beyond its fundamentals when many other newly-listed companies are trading below their sale price. ""The rally in Lovable Lingerie is more a momentum play with hardly any genuine interest,"" says Sharad Rathi, associate director at Almondz Global Securities. ""The valuations seem to be a bit out of whack."" Lovable that sold shares at Rs 205 apiece, has risen 109% to Rs 428.5 on Friday after touching a high of Rs 462.50. Some of the top shareholders include HDFC Mutual Fund, SBI Funds, UTI Asset management and Fidelity, filings show. Total outstanding shares of the firm is at 1.68 crore and public holding is about 50 lakh shares. The Sensex was down 2.6% during the period and the BSE IPO index was up 1.6%. Fineotex Chemical and C Mahendra Exports are the two companies that have returned more than Lovable, among this years' IPOs. The stock trades at 31 times forecast earnings for fiscal 2012, compared with Page Industries' 27 times its earnings. Although the stock had been among the top traded in the last few days, gaining to limit on some days, the number of shares that changed had remained negligible. The quantity of shares actually changing hands — was in single digit for many days. The delivery ratio was 2% to 9% between June 10 and 17 when the stock moved up 33% on BSE, exchange data show. This follows the performance of Page Industries which has gained 396% since its IPO in March 2007. Shares that were sold at Rs 396 apiece are trading at Rs 1,784. ""Rising disposable incomes and growing awareness about personal hygiene are boosting growth of the innerwear market in India,"" said Anand Rathi Secutities in a recent report. ""Also enhancing this growth is the rising modern trade malls, shopping complexes etc,"" said the brokerage which has a target price of Rs 430. The Mumbai-based company's Rs 93-crore IPO drew good response with it getting subscribed 21.8 times the institutional portion, 98.5 times among wealthy individuals and 20.5 times in the retail category. Rise in raw material prices and intensifying competition are the two risks for earnings growth, the report said.Don’t miss out on ET Prime stories!

AdvertisementKoustav DasNew Delhi ,UPDATED: Feb 28, 2023 18:21 ISTIndia's GDP growth slowed to 4.4 per cent in Q3FY23. (Photo: Reuters) By Koustav Das: India’s GDP growth for the quarter ended December 2022 moderated to 4.4 per cent, as per government data. This is a significant drop from the 6.3 per cent GDP growth in the previous quarter. The Q3FY23 GDP growth data, released by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, is slightly below estimates shared by economists. The MoSPI’s release said real GDP in Q3 2022-23 is estimated at Rs 40.19 lakh crore, as against Rs 38.51 lakh crore in Q3 2021-22, showing a growth of 4.4 per cent.advertisementThe data also indicated that real GDP growth for the ongoing financial year is estimated at 7 per cent. Meanwhile, the government estimates nominal GDP to grow at 15.9 per cent in FY23. A poll of economists predicted the economy to grow at 4.6 per cent in the third quarter, in the wake of high inflation and subsequent interest rate hikes since May 2022. The GDP growth data released by the government indicates that economic growth has been slower than expected, and could raise concerns over the growth trajectory going forward, as the global economic situation continues to remain tense. Weaker GDP growth in the third quarter could also impact the central government’s GDP growth projections for the full financial year ending March 2023. The government has predicted the economy to grow at 7 per cent in FY23, while the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has predicted it at 6.8 per cent. Also Read | India’s inflation concern may not be over soon. Here’s whyInflation dents GDP growthWhile GDP growth usually moderates in the third quarter, the bigger-than-expected drop has been triggered by high inflation, which prompted the RBI to maintain a tighter monetary policy and hike key rates multiple times since May 2022. Economic growth could further slowdown in the fourth quarter of FY23 as the RBI had hiked key interest rates in its February policy review. The central bank has hiked key interest rates by 250 basis points this year, leading to a gradual weakening of demand. The GDP growth in the final quarter of the ongoing financial year could further slow down, as per a poll of economists conducted by Reuters. As per the median forecast of 42 economists, the GDP growth in the fourth quarter could come in at 4.4 per cent. It could be even lower, considering the fact that the fresh government estimates show a faster-than-expected decline in GDP growth.Another factor that has been lowering India's quarterly GDP growth is the fading of the pandemic-induced base effect, which had contributed to higher growth in FY22.

PTI file photoNEW DELHI: In a major jolt to the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in Delhi, ministers Manish Sisodia and Satyendar Jain, who have been arrested in different cases, on Tuesday resigned from their posts in the cabinet.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has accepted the resignations of the two leaders, who were instrumental in executing his governance agenda of providing quality education and healthcare facilities in the national capital.Delhi Excise Policy Case Live UpdatesThe resignations come moments after the Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to entertain arrested Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia's petition for quashing the FIR or in the alternative grant him bail from the custody of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).Read AlsoAAP is trying to hide him behind education: Delhi BJPBJP on Monday lashed out at AAP for its protests against the arrest of deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia and asserted that CBI had been acting lawfully against the ""corrupt"". The party also demanded chief minister Arvind Kejriwal's resignation with two of his ministers having been arrested onAccording to the reports, no fresh faces will be inducted into the cabinet, and instead, the portfolios of Sisodia will be allocated to other ministers. Revenue minister Kailash Gahlot and social welfare minister Raj Kumar Anand are expected to take on the responsibilities previously held by Sisodia.The CBI on Sunday arrested Delhi deputy CM Manish Sisodia in connection with their probe into the alleged irregularities in the framing and implementation of the now withdrawn excise policy 2021-22. The move triggered a political storm in the capital with AAP alleging vendetta.In August 2022, Sisodia's name came up in the excise policy scam, which resulted in him also being subjected to scrutiny and criticism.Read AlsoAAP in a spot as Manish Sisodia headed 18 of 33 departments; CM Arvind Kejriwal likely to take on more workDeputy chief minister Manish Sisodia's arrest in the alleged excise policy scam - though widely speculated by many, including chief minister Arvind Kejriwal - has come as a big jolt to the Aam Aadmi Party. Handling 18 of the 33 government departments, Sisodia was not only literally carrying theSisodia’s arrest came as a shock for the AAP government. He was handling 18 of the 33 government departments and his able management gave the CM leverage to focus on the party’s expansion beyond the capital and Punjab. Read AlsoCBI gets Manish Sisodia's custody for five days amid AAP protestsAmid protests by AAP in several states against Manish Sisodia’s arrest, a Delhi court granted the CBI its request for five days’ remand of the Delhi deputy CM to question him about the alleged irregularities in the excise policy of 2021-22.After Satyendar Jain’s arrest, Sisodia was given the former’s portfolios. The opposition BJP had been demanding the resignation of Jain after his arrest in May last year by the Enforcement Directorate in a money laundering case. 1/10What makes Manish Sisodia so important?

He is presently lodged in Tihar Jail in a money laundering case.A day after Manish Sisodia’s arrest by the CBI, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday said his deputy had been framed and taken into custody due to political pressure.Consortium from south formulated excise policy at Delhi hotel, paid Rs 100cr: AgencyTaking to Twitter, the chief minister said his sources in the probe agency had confirmed that there was no evidence against Sisodia. “I am told that most CBI officers were against Manish’s arrest. All of them have huge respect for him and there is no evidence against him. But the political pressure to arrest him was so high that they had to obey their political masters,” Kejriwal tweeted. Calling it a lie, BJP, however, said Kejriwal was trying to build a false narrative.Delhi liquor case: ED probe may lead to senior AAP members in Delhi, say sourcesEven after his arrest, Jain continued to be a minister in the government but without any portfolio. His portfolios, including health, home and urban development, had been handed over to Sisodia.Sisodia's workload had almost doubled after Jain's arrest, and he was handling most of the crucial departments of the city government.Both have led what the AAP describes as the ""successful transformation"" of Delhi's education and health services, contributing to the party's popularity and continued electoral success.The BJP had stepped up its attack on the AAP following Sisodia's arrest and had been demanding his sacking, along with that of Jain, from the Delhi Cabinet.""BJP's struggle has borne fruits. We had been demanding that Manish Sisodia and Satyendar Jain would have to resign and also go to jail. And out of embarrassment, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had to accept their resignations. This is a victory of BJP workers, a victory of truth,"" Delhi BJP working president Virendra Sachdeva said.""Liquor scam has happened with your complicity and right under your nose. You are responsible for it. Our struggle, demanding Kejriwal's resignation, will continue,"" he added.The Congress said Sisodia has been arrested in an ""open-and-shut case of corruption"", and demanded that Kejriwal should be arrested too for his involvement in the liquor scam.Congress leader and former Union minister Ajay Maken said those who formed their party on the anti-corruption plank should answer questions posed on the excise policy, which was formed in complete contradiction of the recommendations of the committee set up by them.""This is an open-and-shut case of corruption and a big scam has happened in Delhi and it should be viewed accordingly,"" he said.AAP party of cut, commission, corruption; Sisodia, Jain should have resigned earlier: BJP The BJP on Tuesday described AAP as a party of ""cut, commission and corruption"" and said its leaders Manish Sisodia and Satyendar Jain should have resigned from the Cabinet much earlier when the graft allegations against them had come to light. Deputy Chief Minister Sisodia was arrested by the CBI on Sunday evening in connection with alleged corruption in the formulation and implementation of the now-scrapped Delhi liquor policy for 2021-22, while Jain is lodged in Tihar Jail in a money laundering case since May last year.The ministers on Tuesday tendered their resignations to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, which have been accepted.Hitting out at the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and its national convener Kejriwal, senior BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad said people who claimed to be the ""flag bearers of the fight against corruption"" have ensured governance that ""increases the number of alcohol users in Delhi"".Without naming any party, Prasad said he thought cut and commission was the legacy of only one political party.""But today, I must say that 3C-cut, commission and corruption also applies for Kejriwal's party,"" Prasad said and added that AAP leaders have defamed the anti-corruption agitation led by Anna Hazare.""They should have resigned earlier. Jain has resigned several months after his arrest and Sisodia should have resigned at the time when the allegations against them came out,"" the former law minister said while addressing a press conference here.Describing the liquor scam case in Delhi as a ""fixed text book case of corruption"", Prasad said the BJP will raise the issue in every corner of the country.He said the Supreme court on Tuesday refused to ""grant any indulgence to one of the ""most prominent faces of the anti-corruption movement led by Anna Hazare"". ""This clearly indicates the merit of Sisodia's plea that the apex court refused to grant any relief,"" Prasad said.The Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to entertain the bail plea of Sisodia, who is in CBI custody in connection with the excise policy case.Sisodia is perhaps the only education minister in the country who is also a ""liquor minister"", the BJP leader said.On Kejriwal, Prasad said that during the Gujarat elections, he claimed that the Intelligence Bureau was reporting a big win for the AA, and on Monday, he claimed that the CBI was not in favour of Sisodia's arrest.""I am amazed at the number of lies spewed by Kejriwal for the commission from liquor,"" he said.(With inputs from agencies)Watch Delhi excise scam: Manish Sisodia, Satyendar Jain quit as ministers; CM Arvind Kejriwal accepts their resignationsStart a ConversationFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIAFacebookTwitterInstagramKOO APPYOUTUBE Visual Stories  Shilpa Shetty vs Bhumi Pednekar: Who rocked the IT blouse better?LifestylePlaces in South India for a refreshing Holi getawaytravelMarathi actresses who stunned in a floral outfitsEntertainment19 habits a good spouse should haveLifestyleRang Majha Vegla actress Anushka Pimputkar's purple saree photoshoot is all about elegancetvMuslim baby boy names with meaning from QuranLifestyleTejasswi Prakash stuns in a green shimmer dress; her party lookstv10 Pics Proving Urvashi Rautela Is An Amazing FashionistaEntertainmentInside Shah Rukh Khan’s LA homeLifestyle123ElectionsAssembly Elecetions 2023Elections 2023Nagaland Election ResultsMeghalaya Election ResultTripura Election ResultKarnataka Elections 2023Exit Polls 2023Tripura Exit PollsTop TrendingExit Polls 2023South Africa vs West IndiesPM Kisan SchemeChandrayaan 3Foreign Ministers MeetBihar Budget 2023 LiveTrending StoriesIn CityEntire WebsiteTraffic snarls at several places in Delhi2 held for demanding, accepting Rs 15k bribeTriple murder in Delhi: Man bought 3 knives onlineDU may launch 18 new courses this sessionA 2011-batch IAS officer & IITian is new Noida DMJoin this IISc course on Intelligent AutomationMIT xPRO’s COO ProgrammeProtect your EV with electric vehicle insuranceHow these students from Delhi scripted a different taleViral: Men steal flower pots set up for G-20Delhi ministers Manish Sisodia, Satyendar Jain resign; BJP says AAP party of 'cut & corruption'India's Q3 GDP at 4.4%; economy to grow at 7% in FY23Story of the costliest apartment ever sold in IndiaSC refuses to entertain Sisodia's plea against his arrest by CBIPb guv had no discretion to delay summoning of assembly: SCJasprit Bumrah likely to miss IPL 2023Manish Sisodia's arrest hurts AAP, but will it help BJP?Quick Edit: GDP data points to stress in economy because of weak consumptionK'taka polls: Cong plans stiff fight against BJP heavyweightsMen driving Kia Carnival steal flower pots set up for G20 eventAbout usCreate Your Own AdTerms of Use and Grievance Redressal Policy Privacy policyAdvertise with usRSSNewsletterFeedbackePaperSitemapArchivesFOLLOW US ONOther Times Group News SitesThe Economic TimesHindi Economic TimesNavbharat TimesMaharashtra TimesVijaya KarnatakaTelugu SamayamTamil SamayamMalayalam SamayamEi SamayI am GujaratTimesPointsIndiatimesBrand CapitalEducation TimesTimes FoodMiss KyraMumbai MirrorBangalore MirrorPopular CategoriesHeadlinesSports NewsBusiness NewsIndia NewsWorld NewsBollywood NewsHealth & Fitness TipsIndian TV ShowsCelebrity PhotosHot on the WebRashmika MandannaHrithik RoshanHoney RosesBollywood CouplesSouth Indian ActorShreyas IyerAbby Choi Murder CaseVastu TipsRakesh SujathasShehnaaz GillTop TrendsExit Polls 2023South Africa vs West IndiesPM Kisan SchemeChandrayaan 3Foreign Ministers MeetBihar Budget 2023 LiveDelhi Excise Policy CaseManish SisodiaPetrol Price in IndiaGautam AdaniIndia GDPBank Holidays in MarchEPFO High PensionNagaland Election ResultMeghalaya Election ResultTripura Election ResultCryptocurrency Price in IndiaIPL Schedule 2023Trending TopicsParineeti ChopraParenting TipsRelationships TipsShark Tank India 2Rich Dosa RecipesGondola Rides In VeniceMalaika AroraMushroom BenefitsSAG Awards 2023Heart DiseasesBest Food For HealthGenelia D'SouzaBollywood Actor TransformationsShanthi PriyaAlia BhattBollywood CelebritiesVivo Y55sLaptops under 30000WiFi RoutersTablets under 15000Living and entertainmentiDivaMensXP.comFeminaETimesGraziaZoomTravel DestinationsBombay TimesCricbuzz.comFilmfareOnline SongsTVLifestyleLongwalks AppNewspaper SubscriptionFood NewsTimes PrimeWhats HotServicesCouponDuniaMagicbricksTechGigTimesJobsBollywood NewsTimes MobileGadgets NowCareersColombiaCopyright © 2023 Bennett, Coleman & Co.

Nadda that they have become ""poll agents"", Karnataka Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai on Tuesday asked whether former AICC President Rahul Gandhi is working as a ""Congress agent"".

Opposition leader and senior Congress leader, Siddaramaiah had slammed Nadda and Shah, saying that they were working as poll agents.

Addressing the media in Hubballi district, Bommai said the statements made by Congress leaders show the frustration of the party.

""They (Congress) were making such statements as they are worried to see a large number of people gathering during Prime Minister Narendra Modi`s visit to Karnataka,"" he added.

""Is it right for the former Chief Minister (Siddaramaiah) to speak in such language. I will leave it to the people,"" Bommai said.

Asked about the JD(S) leader and former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy`s statement that the upcoming state Assembly election will be his last, Bommai said he did not know about the context but this is not the age for retirement as he (Kumaraswamy) still has to serve people.
""All such things happen during the election. The maturity of the voters grows from one election to another. The people will think when politicians speak,"" he added.

He said a `Rath Yatra` will start from March 1-4 and conclude in Davangere after covering all the 224 Assembly constituencies in the state.

""A lot of people will participate in the `Rath Yatra`. The visit of PM Modi, Amit Shah and Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan to Karnataka will get massive support, and thereafter other BJP leaders will also be coming to the state.""

Reacting to another query, the Chief Minister said the BJP Parliamentary Board will decide on the list of candidates for the upcoming state Assembly polls.
Asked about the issue of the ""Go back CM"" campaign in Banavasi, Bommai added that he is not bothered about a few people opposing him, adding that the Rath Yatra programme will be completed at any cost.

For this quarter as well, the pace of growth is seen to have slowed.Read AlsoIndian economy seen losing speed as rising rates hurt demandIndia's GDP growth likely slowed in the October-December period, as rising borrowing costs crimp consumption that's a key growth driver. The slowdown could mean that the government's prior estimate of 7% growth for the fiscal year from April 2022 to March 2023 is too optimistic.The sharp fall in year-on-year growth rate is partly due to a fading of pandemic-induced base effect which had contributed towards higher growth figures in fiscal 2021-22.The figure assumes significance as India is being looked upon as the 'bright spot' amid persistent fears of global slowdown and recession.Sector-wise performance The manufacturing sector continues to disappoint as it shrank by 1.1% year-on-year in the quarter, a second straight contraction reflecting weakness in consumer demand and exports.Meanwhile, electricity, gas, water supply and other utility services expanded by 8.2% as against 6% last quarter. Similary, construction also improved t 8.4% from 5.8% in Q2. Agriculture and mining & quarrying also expanded by 3.7% each, while trade, hotels and transport fell to 9.7%.""The major disappointment is negative growth in manufacturing, which can be attributed to weak P&L accounts of this sector. The Q2 results did indicate a fall in profits due to high input costs,"" Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at Bank of Baroda told Reuters. ""Farm production is to grow by 3.7% which is on account of a good kharif crop. A revival in construction activity by 8.4% propped up low base was also supported by higher level of construction activity in both houses as well as roads,"" Sabnavis added.""Service sector components continued to do well on the back of pent up demand especially in hospitality, travel, trade which led to growth of 9.7% over 9.2% last year,"" he added. Budget 2023 lowered GDP estimatesPresenting the Union Budget for financial year 2023-24 earlier this month, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman lowered India's growth estimates for the current fiscal year to 7% from 8-8.5% projected earlier.For FY24, the government projected India's economic growth to be 6-6.8%, slightly lower than that of current year.Read AlsoEconomy to grow 6-6.8% next year, recovery complete: Annual Economic SurveyThe annual Economic Survey for 2022-23 projected the economy to grow by somewhere between 6% and 6.8%, depending on global factors in 2023-24, with 6.5% a baseline expectation. While admitting that the world economy faces considerable uncertainty that could affect India’s growth, the survey struck aHowever, the Economic Survey tabled in Parliament just a day before the budget presentation estimated GDP to grow by 6-6.8%.This year's budget laid more emphasis on measures boosting economic growth of the country, especially amid widespread fears of recession. Most major economies have already started to feel the heat of a global slowdown as their corporates resort to job cuts.India's budget adopted seven priorities or 'Saptarishi' - inclusive, green growth, reaching the last mile, infra & investment, unleashing the potential, Youth power and financial sector - to deal with current economic challenges.RBI's GDP projectionsAnnouncing its monetary policy outcome earlier this month, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), projected India's economic growth at 6.4% for 2023-24, broadly in line with the estimate of the Economic Survey.Read AlsoRBI projects economic growth at 6.4% for next fiscalIn 2023-24, the growth in the June and September quarter is projected at 7.8 per cent and 6.2 per cent, respectively. In the December and March quarter, the GDP growth is estimated at 6 per cent and 5.8 per cent, respectively.Amid volatile global developments, the Indian economy remains resilient, said RBI governor Shaktikanta Das while unveiling the last bi-monthly monetary policy of the current fiscal.""Available data for Q3 and Q4:2022-23 indicate that economic activity in India remains resilient. Urban consumption demand has been firming up, driven by a sustained recovery in discretionary spending, especially on services, such as travel, tourism and hospitality.""Rural demand continues to show signs of improvement as tractor sales and two-wheeler sales expanded in December,"" he had said.The RBI has raised its benchmark repo rate by 250 basis points since May last year to contain inflation, and economists expect a further rate hike of 25 basis points to 6.75% in April before pausing until year end.At least two members of India's six-member monetary policy committee have called for a pause in rate hikes, citing rising global and local risks to growth.The central bank, however, remains focused on above-target inflation as high-frequency indicators suggests that stronger rural demand may help offset weaker urban consumption.'India a bright spot'Amid the global gloom, India will still retain the tag of the fastest growing thanks to robust domestic demand while China is expected to face a slowdown due to the impact of the lockdown to prevent the spread of Covid-19.The Indian economy has been scripting a recovery after the bruising impact of the Covid-19 pandemic but the global slowdown, the geopolitical situation, stubborn price pressures and the impact of rising interest rates have posed risks to faster expansion.Read AlsoIndia remains 'bright spot', to contribute 15% of global growth in 2023: IMF MDIndia remains a bright spot at a time when the IMF is projecting 2023 to be difficult with global growth slowing down from 3.4 per cent last year to 2.9 per cent in 2023, she observed.Many economists, brokerage firms and agencies like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank have in their latest reports stated that Indian economy will be fastest growing among major economies in financial year 2022-23.Even though existing global challenges like tightening monetary policy cycle, slowing growth and elevated commodity prices may lead to a lower growth than previous financial year, still India's growth will be robust due to strong domestic demand.At present, global economy is navigating through incredibly rough waters attributed mainly to global uncertainties, unfolding of conflict in Ukraine, the reaction of financial and commodity markets to the changing scenarios, tight monetary policy and more.However, despite these hurdles, the World Bank in its latest India development update said that India showed higher resilience to global shocks and better than expected quarterly growth numbers.(With inputs from agencies)Start a ConversationFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIAFacebookTwitterInstagramKOO APPYOUTUBE Visual Stories  Shilpa Shetty vs Bhumi Pednekar: Who rocked the IT blouse better?LifestylePlaces in South India for a refreshing Holi getawaytravelMarathi actresses who stunned in a floral outfitsEntertainment19 habits a good spouse should haveLifestyleRang Majha Vegla actress Anushka Pimputkar's purple saree photoshoot is all about elegancetvMuslim baby boy names with meaning from QuranLifestyleTejasswi Prakash stuns in a green shimmer dress;

Lucknow, Feb 28 (PTI) The war of words between the BJP and the Samajwadi Party over the killing of a prime witness in the 2005 murder case of a former BSP MLA intensified on Tuesday, with both citing pictures of an accused with leaders to point fingers at each other.

While the BJP attacked the SP over a purported picture of Sadakat Khan, who was arrested from the Allahabad University hostel in connection with last week's killing, with SP president Akhilesh Yadav, the opposition party hit back by posting images of Khan with some BJP leaders.

The Congress, meanwhile, alleged that both the Samajwadi Party and the BJP are hand-in-glove with the criminals and were two sides of the same coin.

""The entire state and the country know that the Samajwadi Party has been strengthening criminals. In other words, I can say that it is a nursery of criminals,"" Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Brajesh Pathak said on Akhilesh Yadav's picture that was being shared on social media.

Dismissing the allegation, Samajwadi Party spokesman Rajendra Chaudhary said that in public life many people get their pictures clicked with leaders but this is not an evidence of their having a link with the party or its leadership.

After Umesh Pal, who was the prime witness in then BSP MLA Raju Pal's murder, and his police security guard Sandeep Nishad were shot dead on Friday outside his home in Dhoomanganj area of Prayagraj, Akhilesh Yadav had questioned the law and order situation in the state. In a counter-attack, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had accused the SP of sheltering the mafias and vowed to destroy them.

Among those booked in the case is a gangster-turned politician Atiq Ahmed.

Pathak stressed that the state government has zero tolerance against crime and ""no matter what reach any criminal has, he will not be spared"".

Samajwadi Party media cell in a tweet alleged that the Pal and the murderers were engaged in transactions worth crores and some BJP leaders were also involved in it.

""Umesh Pal understood this conspiracy of the BJP leaders, that's why the BJP got him killed? If there is an investigation of land and other illegal business with BJP leaders, everything will be revealed,"" it claimed.

IP Singh, senior Samajwadi party leader, claimed that a picture of Khan with former BJP MLA Uday Bhan Muni Karvariya has emerged on social media and has been retweeted by his party's media cell.

Commissioner of Prayagraj Police Ramit Sharma had on Monday said that the name of Sadakat Khan, a resident of Ghazipur, had come to light in the conspiracy of the Umesh Pal murder case. He is a student of LLB at Allahabad University and the STF arrested him on Monday.

""Khan has given the names of some people involved in this conspiracy. He has also given information about calls made through social media apps. His room was searched by the police team in his presence. While returning, he tried to flee but fell after colliding with a divider and fell. He has sustained some injuries,"" Sharma added.

The BJP said that whenever serious crimes take place, pictures of the accused with Akhilesh Yadav have emerged.

""Is it a coincidence or an experiment - this has to be seen by everyone,"" BJP spokesman Alok Awasthi said.

""There are no two views on this. Even the children of the state know that those who committed this crime are associated with which party,"" BJP MLA Shalabhmani Tripathi said.

""The challenge before Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath is not just from these criminals but also from those giving political shelter to them to commit crimes and later create an atmosphere that crimes have increased,"" Tripathi added.
In a tweet, the UP Congress shared the picture of Akhilesh Yadav and said: ""Look! Sadakat Khan, the main conspirator of the Umesh Pal murder case, is standing with the former chief minister.

Be it BJP or SP, both are two sides of the same coin in holding hands of criminals.""

Uttar Pradesh Police on Monday gunned down one of the accused in an encounter.

Police claimed that they retaliated when the accused opened fire at them. A police officer was injured during the encounter, they said.
Deputy Commissioner of Police Navendu Kumar told PTI that Arbaaz was the driver of the white SUV used by the assailants to attack witness Umesh Pal.

The account was hacked late on Monday night and its name was changed to 'Yuga Labs'. Along with the name, the display picture has also been changed. ""#DidirSurakshaKawach is a mammoth effort at securing basic sustenance for every resident in Bengal, irrespective of age, gender, caste, or religion.

The logo appeared in a `Y` shape in black font. ""It was restored at around 4 PM after nearly 13 hours,"" a member of the AITC media team said. 

The party lodged a complaint with the cyber cell of Kolkata Police, he said. TMC national spokesperson Derek O'Brien said in a statement this morning that the account was compromised. ""We are in touch with officials from Twitter who are working to rectify the issue. They have assured us of prompt action,"" O'Brien, who is also the leader of the party in Rajya Sabha, said.

After its account was restored, the party, which is in power in Bengal, posted three tweets about 'Didir Suraksha Kavach' (Didi's Protective Shield), its ongoing mass outreach campaign.

The TMC launched the campaign in January this year to ensure that people get benefits from the pro-people projects of the state government. Didi or elder sister denotes Party supremo Mamata Banerjee.

Last year in April, the Twitter account of the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister`s Office (CMO) was hacked.
UP CMO's (@CMOfficeUP) Twitter account has four million followers at present. The breach came to light when unknown hackers used the UP CMO Twitter handle to publish a post based on a tutorial called ""How to turn your BAYC/MAYC animated on Twitter"". 

In addition, a cartoonist picture was used as a profile picture on the UP CMO account. The unidentified hackers also posted a thread of some random tweets on the UP CMO account. Live TvAll India Trinamool Congressyuga labtmc twitter hackedTwitter hackedMamata BanerjeeMore Stories Manish Sisodia Quits Sisodia Resigns As Delhi Deputy CM, Satyendar Jain Too Quits As Minister Bill Gates Bill Gates Visits RBI HQ In Mumbai; Meets Governor ShaktiKanta Das  Gurugram Men Riding Luxury Car Allegedly Steal Flower Pots From G20 Event in Gurugram snap Snap Joins AI Race; Announces To Integrate OpenAI's ChatGPT With Platform manish sisodia arrest Delhi Excise Policy Case: Manish Sisodia Resigns As Deputy Delhi CM India vs Australia 2023 LIVE Updates | IND VS AUS 3rd Test, Day 1 Cricket Match Live Score Ben stokes I’m Not Going To Lie...: Ben Stokes Opens Up On His Availability For CSK KL Rahul Rohit Sharma REVEALS Real Reason Behind Removing KL Rahul As Vice CaptainComments - Join the DiscussionTrending newsDNA VideoDNA: Famous writer Anant Pai passed away on this day in the year 2011DNA VideoDNA: For the first time in the year 1886, Aluminum was made in the laboratoryDNA VideoDNA: When India's first education minister Abul Kalam Azad died in 1958DNA VideoDNA: When will the Russia-Ukraine war end?DNA VideoDNA: Fear of corona infection, Home becomes 'Jail'

There was no occasion for the governor to seek legal advice on this, the SC said.The top court said it is inconceivable that a governor can delay summoning of budget session of assembly and advised both the governor and the CM to maintain and display constitutional maturity.At the same time, the SC cajoled CM Bhagwant Mann for his derogatory tweet and letter to the governor and said it left much to be desired. However, it said that even with the tweet and letter, the governor had no discretion not to summon the House.SC said the language used by the CM in his letter to the governor must be reflective of mature constitutional statesmanship despite political differences and with sobriety. It cannot be a race to the bottom, the SC said on Mann's letter to the governor.The court said that the Punjab government is duty-bound to furnish information as sought by the governor and at the same time the governor is also duty-bound to accept the recommendations of cabinet on the convening of assembly.Start a ConversationFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIAFacebookTwitterInstagramKOO APPYOUTUBE Visual Stories  Inside Shah Rukh Khan’s LA homeLifestyleScenic hiking trails in India for the spring seasontravelChitrangda Singh can slay any look and these pictures are a proofindiaSree Vishnu's best onscreen heroinesEntertainmentBest clicks of Aishwarya MajmudarEntertainmentMost elegant saree looks of Samantha Ruth PrabhuEntertainment10 times Kiara Advani's mom Genevieve Advani dressed better than any Bollywood celebLifestyleKhushi Kapoor sets hearts racing with her bewitching photosindiaKedarnath Temple to get golden urn during Chardham Yatra this yearLifestyle123ElectionsAssembly Elecetions 2023Elections 2023Nagaland Election ResultsMeghalaya Election ResultTripura Election ResultKarnataka Elections 2023Exit Polls 2023Tripura Exit PollsTop TrendingExit Polls 2023South Africa vs West IndiesPM Kisan SchemeChandrayaan 3Foreign Ministers MeetBihar Budget 2023 LiveTrending StoriesIn IndiaEntire WebsitePunjab governor had no discretion to delay summoning of assembly: Supreme CourtBBC documentary on Modi: Can you run down SC and two decades of probe in name of expression, asks Jagdeep DhankarWorld's longest cruise MV Ganga Vilas reaches Dibrugarh; completes 50-day river journeyMeet the Muslims BJP wants to wooPumping up the price: Why are petrol prices still so high in India?Join this IISc course on Intelligent AutomationMIT xPRO’s COO ProgrammeProtect your EV with electric vehicle insurance'BJP scared of Lalu Yadav in Bihar, sending central agencies': Rabri DeviS Jaishankar: India expects FTA with EU to be 'game-changer'Live: SC refuses to entertain Sisodia's plea against his arrest, suggests him to move Delhi HCLive: Govt to release Q3 GDP numbers shortlyWhy Pakistan will go Afghanistan way, not Sri LankaChinese foreign minister to visit India on sidelines of G20Rahul's removal as vice-captain indicates nothing: RohitJagan dares Chandrababu Naidu to contest all seats in AndhraMeet the Muslims BJP wants to wooPunjab guv had no discretion to delay summoning of assembly: SCParticipate in the Times EdTech Survey'Mentally unstable' man kills mother with spade in PunjabAbout usCreate Your Own AdTerms of Use and Grievance Redressal Policy Privacy policyAdvertise with usRSSNewsletterFeedbackePaperSitemapArchivesFOLLOW US ONOther Times Group News SitesThe Economic TimesHindi Economic TimesNavbharat TimesMaharashtra TimesVijaya KarnatakaTelugu SamayamTamil SamayamMalayalam SamayamEi SamayI am GujaratTimesPointsIndiatimesBrand CapitalEducation TimesTimes FoodMiss KyraMumbai MirrorBangalore MirrorPopular CategoriesHeadlinesSports NewsBusiness NewsIndia NewsWorld NewsBollywood NewsHealth & Fitness TipsIndian TV ShowsCelebrity PhotosHot on the WebRashmika MandannaHrithik RoshanHoney RosesBollywood CouplesSouth Indian ActorShreyas IyerAbby Choi Murder CaseVastu TipsRakesh SujathasShehnaaz GillTop TrendsExit Polls 2023South Africa vs West IndiesPM Kisan SchemeChandrayaan 3Foreign Ministers MeetBihar Budget 2023 LiveDelhi Excise Policy CaseManish SisodiaPetrol Price in IndiaGautam AdaniIndia GDPBank Holidays in MarchEPFO High PensionNagaland Election ResultMeghalaya Election ResultTripura Election ResultCryptocurrency Price in IndiaIPL Schedule 2023Trending TopicsParineeti ChopraParenting TipsRelationships TipsShark Tank India 2Rich Dosa RecipesGondola Rides In VeniceMalaika AroraMushroom BenefitsSAG Awards 2023Heart DiseasesBest Food For HealthGenelia D'SouzaBollywood Actor TransformationsShanthi PriyaAlia BhattBollywood CelebritiesVivo Y55sLaptops under 30000WiFi RoutersTablets under 15000Living and entertainmentiDivaMensXP.comFeminaETimesGraziaZoomTravel DestinationsBombay TimesCricbuzz.comFilmfareOnline SongsTVLifestyleLongwalks AppNewspaper SubscriptionFood NewsTimes PrimeWhats HotServicesCouponDuniaMagicbricksTechGigTimesJobsBollywood NewsTimes MobileGadgets NowCareersColombiaCopyright © 2023 Bennett, Coleman & Co.

SC Refuses To Hear Sisodia's Plea 
Earlier today, the Supreme Court declined to hear the bail plea of Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, who is in CBI custody, in connection with the excise policy case, news agency PTI reported. The Aam Aadmi Party will now move to Delhi HC over Sisodia's arrest, news agency ANI reported.

A bench comprising Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justice P S Narasimha has refused to intervene in Sisodia’s case, and asked him to 'avail alternative remedies'. The Delhi Deputy Chief Minister approached SC on Tuesday for bail in the excise policy case.

 The top court observed that the arrested AAP leader has remedies under the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) to move the Delhi High Court for bail and seek the quashing of the FIR. A special Delhi court on Monday sent Sisodia to five-day CBI remand in the excise policy case to allow the agency to get ""genuine and legitimate"" answers to questions being put to him for ""a proper and fair.

Earlier this month, the agency had interrogated Delhi minister Satyendar Jain in Tihar Jail in connection with the case after taking permission from the judge.

Jain was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate in a money laundering case. He is not an accused in the excise policy case.
The CBI had also quizzed AAP's communication in-charge Vijay Nair, who is also lodged in Tihar Jail, in connection with the excise policy money laundering case being probed by the ED.

Nair was earlier granted bail in the CBI excise policy case by the court.Live Tvmanish sisodia resignationmanish sisodia arrestKailash GahlotRaaj Kumar Ananddelhi liquor policy caseSatyendar Jainaap protestsdelhi liquor scammanish sisodia newsMore Stories Manish Sisodia Quits Sisodia Resigns As Delhi Deputy CM, Satyendar Jain Too Quits As Minister Bill Gates Bill Gates Visits RBI HQ In Mumbai; Meets Governor ShaktiKanta Das  Gurugram Men Riding Luxury Car Allegedly Steal Flower Pots From G20 Event in Gurugram snap Snap Joins AI Race; Announces To Integrate OpenAI's ChatGPT With Platform manish sisodia arrest Delhi Excise Policy Case: Manish Sisodia Resigns As Deputy Delhi CM India vs Australia 2023 LIVE Updates | IND VS AUS 3rd Test, Day 1 Cricket Match Live Score Ben stokes I’m Not Going To Lie...: Ben Stokes Opens Up On His Availability For CSK KL Rahul Rohit Sharma REVEALS Real Reason Behind Removing KL Rahul As Vice CaptainComments - Join the DiscussionTrending newsDNA VideoDNA: Famous writer Anant Pai passed away on this day in the year 2011DNA VideoDNA: For the first time in the year 1886, Aluminum was made in the laboratoryDNA VideoDNA: When India's first education minister Abul Kalam Azad died in 1958DNA VideoDNA: When will the Russia-Ukraine war end?DNA VideoDNA: Fear of corona infection, Home becomes 'Jail'

Harinath Ram alleged that Raj Kapoor Singh had violated an agreement under which he was supposed to buy a piece of land for him elsewhere as the memorial was constructed on land belonging to him, which blocked his movement to his house.Read | 3 separate brawls, 'outsider' Chinese troops & more: Most detailed account of the brutal June 15 Galwan battleRaj Kapoor Singh was arrested after a case was filed against him for violating Indian Penal Code (IPC) Sections 188, 323, 504 and 506, as well as various sections of the SC/ST Act.""The police told me to remove the memorial within 15 days.

Now protect the EV with electric vehicle InsuranceWould be great to have MS Dhoni in SA20: Aiden MarkramSunrisers Hyderabad IPL 2023 Schedule: Full league stage schedule, matches timings, venues and full squad(IPL Photo)NEW DELHI: Jasprit Bumrah's long-awaited return to cricket dealt another blow with the Indian pace spearhead all set to miss the upcoming Indian Premier League (IPL) 2023, ESPNCricinfo reported on Tuesday.Mumbai Indians pacer Bumrah, who has been out of action at the international level since September 2022, has been given the option of undergoing back surgery.There is a possibility that Bumrah could also miss the World Test Championship final (subject to India's qualification) scheduled to be played from June 7 onwards at The OvalBumrah missed the T20 World Cup, Bangladesh tour and the home series versus Sri Lanka and New Zealand. He is also not part of either the Test or the ODI team for the Australia series.The medical staff of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bengaluru is treating Bumrah's case urgently and suggested him to undergo surgery after facing recurring niggles in his lower back which surfaced originally in the form of stress reaction last August.A final decision on the next step is expected to be taken soon by BCCI in coordination with the NCA and Bumrah, keeping in mind the ICC Cricket World Cup, which is set to take place in India from October-November this year.It has been a frustrating wait for Bumrah, who has attempted to make a comeback more than once since suffering a back injury in August which ruled him out of the Asia Cup. Initially, the injury did not seem serious as he was named in India's T20 World Cup squad in September and even played the last two T20Is against Australia on September 23 and 25.Three days later, Bumrah did not play the first T20I against South Africa and it was learnt that he was taken for scans, which revealed a stress-related injury in his back. He was rushed to NCA and the scans there confirmed that the injury was serious. It ruled him out of the T20 World Cup, in which India achieved a semifinal finish.Bumrah resumed his rehab in November and started to bowl in mid-December. His progress seemed to be positive as he was added in the white-ball series played in January more than a week after the original squad was picked up.Bumrah had performed the match simulation exercises in the NCA, but discomfort resurfaced while taking up higher workloads during fitness drills in January. Scans revealed the development of a fresh niggle, which ruled him out of the Sri Lanka series and Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia.Indian team management and skipper Rohit Sharma want Bumrah to return back to the side only after gaining full fitness, with Rohit warning against rushing the pacer back into the team.(With ANI Inputs)Start a ConversationFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIAFacebookTwitterInstagramKOO APPYOUTUBE Visual Stories  Tejasswi Prakash stuns in a green shimmer dress; her party lookstv10 Pics Proving Urvashi Rautela Is An Amazing FashionistaEntertainmentInside Shah Rukh Khan’s LA homeLifestyleScenic hiking trails in India for the spring seasontravelChitrangda Singh can slay any look and these pictures are a proofindiaSree Vishnu's best onscreen heroinesEntertainmentBest clicks of Aishwarya MajmudarEntertainmentMost elegant saree looks of Samantha Ruth PrabhuEntertainment10 times Kiara Advani's mom Genevieve Advani dressed better than any Bollywood celebLifestyle123Hockey World CupGraham ReidHockey World CupHockey World Cup 2023Hockey World Cup ScheduleHockey World Cup Points TableHockey World Cup TrophyRourkela Birsa Munda Hockey StadiumTop TrendingExit Polls 2023South Africa vs West IndiesPM Kisan SchemeChandrayaan 3Foreign Ministers MeetBihar Budget 2023 LiveTrending StoriesIn SportsEntire Website3rd Test: India eye WTC final spot against down and out Australia'What the hell am I doing': Smith on his disappointing dismissalIndia thinking of simulating English conditions in AhmedabadKL's removal as vice-captain indicates nothing: Rohit'Pleasant surprise': Sachin on his life-size statue at WankhedeJoin this IISc course on Intelligent AutomationMIT xPRO’s COO ProgrammeProtect your EV with electric vehicle insuranceSteve Smith reckons Indore pitch to be another rank turnerLive Score: South Africa vs West Indies, 1st Test, Day 1Arrested ministers Sisodia, Satyendar Jain quit Delhi cabinet; Kejriwal accepts resignationsLive: India's Q3 GDP at 4.4%; economy to grow at 7% in FY23Is Amritpal Singh Punjab's Bhindranwale 2.0?SC refuses to entertain Sisodia's plea against his arrest by CBIPb guv had no discretion to delay summoning of assembly: SCRahul's removal as vice-captain indicates nothing: RohitWhy Banga being a corporate czar is good for World BankMen driving Kia Carnival steal flower pots set up for G20 eventParticipate in the Times EdTech SurveyJagan dares Chandrababu Naidu to contest all seats in AndhraAbout usCreate Your Own AdTerms of Use and Grievance Redressal Policy Privacy policyAdvertise with usRSSNewsletterFeedbackePaperSitemapArchivesFOLLOW US ONOther Times Group News SitesThe Economic TimesHindi Economic TimesNavbharat TimesMaharashtra TimesVijaya KarnatakaTelugu SamayamTamil SamayamMalayalam SamayamEi SamayI am GujaratTimesPointsIndiatimesBrand CapitalEducation TimesTimes FoodMiss KyraMumbai MirrorBangalore MirrorPopular CategoriesHeadlinesSports NewsBusiness NewsIndia NewsWorld NewsBollywood NewsHealth & Fitness TipsIndian TV ShowsCelebrity PhotosHot on the WebRashmika MandannaHrithik RoshanHoney RosesBollywood CouplesSouth Indian ActorShreyas IyerAbby Choi Murder CaseVastu TipsRakesh SujathasShehnaaz GillTop TrendsExit Polls 2023South Africa vs West IndiesPM Kisan SchemeChandrayaan 3Foreign Ministers MeetBihar Budget 2023 LiveDelhi Excise Policy CaseManish SisodiaPetrol Price in IndiaGautam AdaniIndia GDPBank Holidays in MarchEPFO High PensionNagaland Election ResultMeghalaya Election ResultTripura Election ResultCryptocurrency Price in IndiaIPL Schedule 2023Trending TopicsParineeti ChopraParenting TipsRelationships TipsShark Tank India 2Rich Dosa RecipesGondola Rides In VeniceMalaika AroraMushroom BenefitsSAG Awards 2023Heart DiseasesBest Food For HealthGenelia D'SouzaBollywood Actor TransformationsShanthi PriyaAlia BhattBollywood CelebritiesVivo Y55sLaptops under 30000WiFi RoutersTablets under 15000Living and entertainmentiDivaMensXP.comFeminaETimesGraziaZoomTravel DestinationsBombay TimesCricbuzz.comFilmfareOnline SongsTVLifestyleLongwalks AppNewspaper SubscriptionFood NewsTimes PrimeWhats HotServicesCouponDuniaMagicbricksTechGigTimesJobsBollywood NewsTimes MobileGadgets NowCareersColombiaCopyright © 2023 Bennett, Coleman & Co.

A bench headed by Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud said that the court is not inclined to entertain the petition at this stage and suggested Sisodia to move to Delhi High Court. ""It can not interfere in the matter as it may open the gate of people approaching the top court in every such matter,"" the court remarked.

Delhi`s Rouse Avenue Court on Monday sent him to CBI custody for 5 days. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has quizzed Delhi`s Minister Satyendar Jain in Tihar Jail in connection with alleged corruption in the implementation of the Delhi Excise Policy.Jain is presently lodged in Judicial Custody in connection with another case related to money laundering case registered by the Enforcement Directorate (ED).His name surfaced in the matter along with another cabinet Minister of Delhi as well as Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal.

AdvertisementIndia Today Sports DeskNew Delhi,UPDATED: Feb 28, 2023 17:31 ISTBen Stokes confirmed he will play in IPL 2023 (AP Photo)In ShortBen Stokes was bought by CSK for a whopping sum of Rs 16.25 croreStokes was managing a knee injury during the Test series vs New ZealandEngland lost the 2nd Test by the barest of margins in Wellington on MondayBy India Today Sports Desk: England captain Ben Stokes confirmed on Monday, February 28 that he will definitely confirm his Indian Premier League (IPL) 2023 commitments for Chennai Super Kings despite his knee injury concern. Stokes was struggling with the knee injury during the 2-Test series against New Zealand in New Zealand which ended in a 1-1 draw on Monday. advertisementBen Stokes bowled only 2 overs in the 2nd Test which ended in a thrilling 1-run win for New Zealand, who fought back after being asked to follow after they were bundled out for 209. Stokes was in visible discomfort as he was going through pain in his knee when batting in the 2nd Test. Stokes hit 27 in the first innings and hit 33 after managing to stay for 116 balls in the 2nd innings but it was not enough for England who agonisingly lost by 1 run. Stokes had hinted earlier this month that he would probably miss the business end of IPL 2023 to prepare for the one-off Test against Ireland, which gets underway from June 1. The Ashes gets underway from June 16 and Stokes said being fit and completing his duty as an all-rounder is his priority. IPL 2023 will get underway from March 31 and the final will be played on May 28 and Stokes said he has been discussing his workload management plan with Chennai Super Kings head coach Stephen Fleming. Stokes, who missed the IPL 2022 season and suffered an injury in 2021, was bought by Chennai Super Kings for Rs 16.25 crore. ""I am going to the IPL. I have had conversations with ‘Flem’ and he’s fully aware of the situation with my body. It’s a week by week case at the moment,"" Stokes said after the 2nd Test in Wellington. 'NOT GOING TO LIE'Stokes has been sensational as England's Test captain, winning 10 of his 13 Tests. He and head coach Brendon McCullum have changed the face of England cricket, playing an aggressive brand that is referred to as the Bazball. Stokes, however, highlighted the importance of the Ashes, saying he is hoping to be full fit to lead from the front while conceding that the injury concern has been holding him back. ""I am not going to lie, it’s incredibly frustrating knowing something has been holding me back from performing as I’d like to. I have been working hard with the physios and the medics trying to get myself to a place where I can fulfil my role as I have done for the last 10 year,"" he added. ‘I’ve got a four-month period now to get it better before the Ashes because I want to be turning up for the first Test in Birmingham able to fulfil my role properly. I’ll be doing everything I can to give myself the best opportunity not to have to worry about it.’--- ENDS ---Also Read |  India vs Australia: KL Rahul's removal as vice-captain doesn't indicate anything, says Rohit Sharma

Now protect the EV with electric vehicle InsuranceSaudis put it across IndiaBengaluru United, ASC advance to semisThe main opposition party is still in the process of selecting candidates and names are yet to be finalised, a senior functionary suggested Kulkarni’s candidature from Shiggaon would be idealBENGALURU: The Congress party appears to be changing tack on selection of candidates for key constituencies, including Shiggaon, currently represented by chief minister Basavaraj Bommai, as they plan to give BJP heavyweights a run for their money.In Shiggaon for example, Congress is planning to field former minister Vinay Kulkarni instead of Sayeed Azeempeer Khadri in a bid to take advantage of ‘perceived’ angst of Panchamasali Lingayats against Bommai and the current dispensation over the reservation issue.While the main opposition party is still in the process of selecting candidates and names are yet to be finalised, a senior functionary suggested Kulkarni’s candidature from Shiggaon would be ideal.“Vinay’s candidature will help us cash in on the anger of the Panchamasali community against the BJP government and especially against Bommai over the delay in providing reservation for the community under 2A category,” said the functionary.But sources say Vinay is undecided as he is keen on winning Dharwad Rural seat, which he represented thrice before losing to BJP in 2018. He is also weighing the option of fielding his wife from Dharwad Rural if the party insists he contest from Shiggaon.Khadri has been unsuccessfully against Bommai since 2004. Congress had named him in previous elections with an eye on Muslim votes, the second biggest chunk after Panchamasalis. If Vinay refuses to contest from Shiggaon, the party is planning to field former Byadagi MLA Basavaraj Shivannavar, a Kuruba.In Dharwad West, represented by Aravind Bellad, who was in the running to replace BS Yediyurappa as chief minister, Congress is mullin g nominating Santosh Lad. The move is being planned with an eye on consolidating the considerable Maratha community vote. Congress’ SR More, a Maratha, had won the seat four times before BJP wrested it two decades ago.However, Lad is said to be keen on contesting from Kalaghatagi, which he represented twice, before losing in 2018. A tussle between KPCC president DK Shivakumar and opposition leader Siddaramaiah over the candidate for Kalaghatagi is also behind the idea. While Siddaramaiah is keen on fielding Lad from Kalaghatagi, Shivakumar is said to be backing Nagaraj Chabbi. As a consensus, the party is likely to field one of them from Dharwad West.The party is also in talks with BJP MLC Puttanna whom they are hoping to field from Rajajinagar (Bengaluru), currently represented by BJP’s S Suresh Kumar.In Chikkamagaluru, the party is looking for a Lingayat candidate to take on incumbent and BJP national general secretary CT Ravi. Sources say the party may field BH Harish, who contested from JD(S) and polled 38,000 votes in 2018, or HD Thammaiah, an aide of Ravi.

The Aam Aadmi Party will now move to Delhi HC over Sisodia's arrest, news agency ANI reported. A bench comprising Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justice P S Narasimha has refused to intervene in Sisodia’s case, and asked him to 'avail alternative remedies'. The Delhi Deputy Chief Minister approached SC on Tuesday for bail in the excise policy case. The top court observed that the arrested AAP leader has remedies under the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) to move the Delhi High Court for bail and seek the quashing of the FIR. A special Delhi court on Monday sent Sisodia to five-day CBI remand in the excise policy case to allow the agency to get ""genuine and legitimate"" answers to questions being put to him for ""a proper and fair

The trial judge said though the accused had joined the investigation of this case on two earlier occasions, it has also been observed that he has failed to provide satisfactory answers to most of the questions put to him during his examination and interrogation. Thus, he has failed to legitimately explain the incriminating evidence which has allegedly surfaced against him during the investigation conducted so far.

It is true that he cannot be expected to make self-incriminating statements, but the interests of justice and of a fair investigation require him to come up with some legitimate answers to the questions which are being put to him by the investigating officer (IO), the trial judge had said.

The CBI on Sunday evening arrested Sisodia in connection with alleged corruption in the formulation and implementation of the now-scrapped liquor policy for 2021-22.

Earlier this month, the agency had interrogated Delhi minister Satyendar Jain in Tihar Jail in connection with the case after taking permission from the judge.

Jain was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate in a money laundering case. He is not an accused in the excise policy case.
The CBI had also quizzed AAP's communication in-charge Vijay Nair, who is also lodged in Tihar Jail, in connection with the excise policy money laundering case being probed by the ED.

MahajanNew Delhi,UPDATED: Feb 28, 2023 18:27 ISTAmritpal Singh Sandhu, self-styled ‘Bhindranwale 2.0’, has positioned himself as a new fulcrum for the panthic cause; (Photo: Bandeep Singh)(NOTE: This is a reprint of an article that was published in the INDIA TODAY edition dated February 20, 2023)On the outskirts of Amritsar, a 10-minute ride off NH-3, lies Jallupur Khera. Till a year ago, it was just another quiet hamlet on the Majha continuum, typical of the soil-born prosperity of this northwestern frontier belt of Punjab. Soothing acres of flat greens, swanky SUVs parked in palatial bungalows, cheek by jowl with big tractors. Not the hub of any activity larger than farming, except on Sangrand—or Sankranti—when Sandhu Jat Sikhs in the vicinity come visiting to pay obeisance at the gurdwara on the premises of the dera of their medieval-age patron saint, Baba Kala Mehar. That changed in the middle of August last year, when Jallupur Khera registered on Punjab’s consciousness in a way that reawakened memories of a dark, stormy past. The man responsible for it: a 30-year-old Dubai-returned Sikh radical, Amritpal Singh Sandhu. advertisementAfter a decade handling his family’s transport business in the emirate, Amritpal returned to take charge of Waris Punjab De (Heirs of Punjab), a Sikh socio-religious group formed by actor-turned-activist Deep Sidhu, who died in February 2022 in a mysterious car accident. Turbanless and with a stylish Van Dyke beard, Amritpal looked like any other chic Punjabi youngster in Dubai. That image underwent a stark revision in public, when he took the baptismal amrit and had his dastarbandi (ceremonial turban-tying) at the end of last September. More striking was the venue: Rode in Moga district, ancestral village of slain terrorist and radical icon Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale. Also of his nephew Lakhbir Singh Rode, chief of the Khalistan Zindabad Force, or KZF. After a two-decade lull beginning mid-’90s, as a fatigued, battle-scarred Punjab sutured itself back to normalcy, those names had receded into a subconscious no one wished to reopen. Khalistan, as an idea and political fantasy, was more or less relegated to the past tense by Sikhs in India—a prime minister from the community serving for a decade from 2004-14 did no harm to that mental movement. But it didn’t go entirely extinct. Of late, that currency has been regaining some emotional value for a variety of reasons, as the panthic sector in Punjab politics responds to perceived crises with a nervous regression. Does the arrival of Amritpal—as a self-styled ‘Bhindranwale 2.0’—inaugurate a new chapter of that troubling story? When INDIA TODAY met him in January, he was ensconced in the 8x8 weatherproof tent he’d set up at a ground adjacent to the Jallupur Khera gurdwara, sitting on an electrically heated floor, swathed in blankets, to ward off the northern chill. In the backdrop: a life-size portrait of Guru Gobind Singh...and a photo of Bhindranwale. Currently on a Khalsa vaheer (march to spread Sikhism), Amritpal’s antics have disinterred the buried ghosts of Khalistan. His speeches mix talk of a “silent genocide” of Sikhs with homilies on a return to piety to end all suffering, such as drug addiction. It’s not spiritualism of a quietist vein. He’s not above asking youth to take up arms in defence of the faith—and that has consequences. In November, one Sandeep Singh, alias Sunny, picked up his licensed .32-bore gun and shot down the self-styled radical Hindu leader Sudhir Suri in broad daylight in Amritsar. Sunny admitted to being influenced by Amritpal, though police could not establish any direct link. The Bhagwant Mann regime, in fact, issued a diktat in mid-November banning the public display of weapons. But Amritpal openly advocates brandishing arms. advertisementIf Amritpal has developed a cohort of radical Sikh youth, following his words keenly in Punjab’s dust-caked plains and in online spaces, it is because of the churn that has beset panthic politics—where religious fervour often strays from orthodoxy to radicalism. The old vanguard of panthic politics— the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD)—is in steep decline, after over a century of panthic voices dominating Sikh religious as well as political discourse. None of the lesser Akali factions is strong enough to replace the Badal-controlled SAD. Party chief Sukhbir Badal’s father Parkash Badal had rebuilt the Akali Dal in 1995, bringing the fragmented leadership together. After the SAD’s famous Moga convention, Badal Sr pretty much captured the panthic space—most hardliners like Simranjit Mann or Gurcharan Tohra were marginalised. From those commanding heights, the roots of the present decline were sown as the SAD declared itself a secular, pan-Punjab party, allied with the BJP and even fielded Hindu candidates for assembly polls. In 2019, the Badals presided over an even steeper fall with their stance on Article 370 and the Citizenship Amendment Act, going against the grain of federalism that has always marked Sikh politics. And even if it broke with the BJP on the farm laws, the long association cost it dearly and added to its image of being far removed from its panthic Jat Sikh base. The accusations of outright mismanagement during the 2015 incidents of sacrilege of Sikh scriptures, when it was in power, crowned that sense of apathy. advertisementLast year’s polls put only three SAD faces in the assembly, none with a panthic background. The party, whose vote share usually ranges between the mid-30s and mid-40s, managed only 18-odd per cent. In the subsequent bypoll for the Sangrur Lok Sabha seat, it was the old radical Simranjit Singh Mann who won; the Badal faction attempted to win back radical sympathies by fielding Kamaldeep Kaur Rajoana, the sister of Balwant Rajoana, who was convicted in the Beant Singh assassination, but she came a poor fifth. FILLING A VACUUMAs former parliamentarian Tarlochan Singh puts it, Punjab feels the lack of a genuine Sikh leader—social, religious or political—profoundly. He also points to other absences, asking why the apex court, the armed forces brass or top bureaucracy lack Sikh faces. It is in this vacuum that the new panthic faces are finding a following. Most analyses of the dramatic rise of AAP ascribe it to the feelings of anger against the established bodies, primarily the Sikh ones, that were perceived to have fallen into lethargy. Now Mann’s regime is also being accused, even by its own MLAs, of not following up on the 2015 incidents or the subsequent police firing that killed two protesters at Behbal Kalan near Kotkapura, in Faridkot district. As Amritpal says: “Even after seven years, there is no justice.” Official inaction means the radicals may be arrogating to themselves the role of judge, jury and executioner. On November 10, Pradeep Singh, an accused in the sacrilege cases, was gunned down in Kotkapura. Canada-based gangster Goldy Brar, also accused of orchestrating the murder of singer-turned-politician Sidhu Moosewala, claimed responsibility. The cops nabbed the shooters, but have not established a motive or link. advertisementIn retrospect, the whole trail seems marked by omissions and evasions. The Behbal Kalan Insaaf Morcha, which has been on a sit-in protest for over 400 days now, has demanded the resignation of Vidhan Sabha Speaker Kultar Singh Sandhwan, the local MLA from Kotkapura who in the past was among the protesters. The Mann regime has been wary, almost inviting comparisons with the scenario painted earlier by AAP MLA and former IGP Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh, who had alleged the two previous SIT investigations into the October 2015 police firing were aimed more at shielding politicians than nailing the culprits. “Two years ago, the Punjab and Haryana High Court had quashed my investigation into the Kotkapura incident. The Congress and Mann governments have also not pursued the case,” he says. Even on inter-state issues, the Mann regime, after initial goof-ups, is perceived to be toeing the established line. Panthic voters are very sensitive on the issue of Chandigarh and feel strongly about Punjab—a Sikh-majority state—not having a capital of its own after losing its original capital, Lahore, to Pakistan. The overriding sentiment is that Chandigarh was built to compensate for this loss. Equally close to panthic hearts is the question of letting Punjab waters flow into the SYL canal. Radicals like Simranjit Mann or newbies like Amritpal keep stoking these sentiments. The AAP government is moving cautiously. In June last year, it allowed a Dal Khalsa protest march against Operation Blue Star and in support of the slain Bhindranwale. AAP leaders in Punjab say they believe in freedom of speech for everyone, but insist that violence will not be allowed. “Anyone indulging in violence has been booked and arrested,” says AAP Punjab spokesperson Malwinder Kang. The party does have legislators from a panthic background, like Kultar Sandhwan, Gurmeet Singh Khuddian and Jaswinder Singh Ramdas. But unlike his predecessors Capt. Amarinder Singh and Badal, Mann, who comes from a Left background, has shown little interest in panthic politics. Caution, however, is not helping the AAP regime escape the crossfire, like when the panthics demand the release of Sikh militants who remain lodged in Punjab and Delhi jails for decades now. “If India can release Rajiv Gandhi’s killers, or the Bilkis Bano rape accused, why can’t they release the Sikh prisoners?” asks Simranjit Mann. The list of ‘Bandi Singhs’, as they are called, has several names associated with the terrorism of the ‘80s-90s, including Rajoana. The father of his co-conspirator Jagtar Singh Hawara, Gurcharan Singh Hawara, floated the Qaumi Insaf Morcha, and has taken his protest to the Mohali-Chandigarh highway to seek the release of Jagtar and 21 others. Hawara Jr was anointed a parallel jathedar of the Akal Takht in November 2016. Although the SGPC is backing the protest, chief Harjinder Singh Dhami was roughed up on January 18 when he visited the protest site. It’s a nightmare situation for the security agencies; if Hawara Jr is ever released, the radicals will move to make him the next Akal Takht jathedar, which may spread radicalisation further. The SGPC has set up an 11-member panel with leaders from all panthic factions to push for their release. The Badals, post their exit from the NDA, were also pushing to be part of the campaign, but several Sikh preachers, among them Baljit Singh Daduwal who wields influence in both Punjab and Haryana, saw it as a plank by a desperate Sukhbir to revive his fortunes. WHO’LL PLAY BOSS?These days, panthic ire is also trained on the government in neighbouring Haryana. In December, the M.L. Khattar regime there constituted an ad hoc 38-member Haryana Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (HSGMC)—pursuant to the apex court ratifying, in September, the constitutional validity of a 2014 legislation passed by the then Congress regime. Panthic Sikhs see it as a move to divide Sikhs further. As it is, the SGPC has control only in Punjab, Himachal, J&K and Chandigarh now. The pain was reflected in Akal Takht jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh’s Facebook post where he said the apex court verdict was akin to a second “geographical murder of SGPC” (the 1947 loss of turf being the first). A line that followed was more inflammatory: “I wish! Sikh sentiments should be respected even for an independent political system.” The pointed allusion was not lost on anyone.In a conversation with INDIA TODAY, Khattar said separate management of gurdwaras was not going to affect the unity of the faith. But the swiftness with which his regime moved has sparked a war with SGPC president Dhami and the Akal Takht jathedar. Dhami told INDIA TODAY that the BJP-RSS is interfering in Sikh religious affairs and the HSGMC was part of this. Even those among the Sikh clergy who back Khattar’s move criticise the appointment of Mahant Karamjit Singh, chief of the Yamunanagar-based Sewapanthi sect, as the chief of the new body. Panthic leaders do not consider the Sewapanthi as part of the fold, nor do they accept a mahant as the chief of a gurdwara management body. Daduwal, who’s a former president of HSGMC, tells INDIA TODAY, “No Sikh can accept anyone other than the Guru Granth Sahib as the patron of any Sikh body.” The issue has handed panthic leaders and radicals a surcharged issue to play with—freeing gurdwaras from “government control”. Even moderate Sikhs are seeking an All India Sikh Gurdwara Act to have a reunited SGPC. THE KHALISTAN SPECTREPanthic leaders, however, walk the razor’s edge as their demands are often misunderstood to be in aid of the Khalistan cause. “Extremism appears romantic, but isn’t,” says Chanan Singh, a rehabilitated extremist. “We have gone through the struggle and know that no parents want their sons killed.” Which is why Amritpal’s antics have put him in confrontation with other panthic groups. Things flared up on December 9 when Amritpal’s supporters broke furniture at a gurdwara in Kapurthala’s Biharipur village. Days later, they repeated the act at a gurdwara in Jalandhar’s Model Town. Amritpal justified the vandalism, saying seating arrangements at the same level as the Guru Granth Sahib were sacrilegious. But all signs are that these incidents have lessened his pull. For, a lot of water has flowed down the Sutlej since the cordite-choked ‘80s-90s. The demand for a separate homeland resonates only among a section of the Jat Sikhs, and it’s tied up with their self-image of social dominance. Khalistan has no appeal among the Hindu population or to the vast OBC and Dalit segment across religions. The former makes up 32 per cent of Punjab’s population. And cumulatively, the lesser endowed castes total about 65 per cent. OBC and Dalit Sikhs derive their spiritual sustenance and protective cover from the deras and other outfits that have sprung up in the past four decades. It’s these that panthic outfits are waging war on—be it Amritpal against the Christian pastors working among Dalit Sikhs, or Dera Sacha Sauda’s continuous confrontation with canonical Sikhism. That’s why Subhash Chander Singh, chief of the Radha Soami Dera Teja Singh at Amritsar, says: “There are no takers for Khalistan, some people are just using it for their own benefit. The real issues Punjab and Sikhism face are drugs, pollution of soil, air and water, and livelihood.” Former Punjab DGP Shashi Kant too sees the radical element as outsiders. “These fringe elements keep making noise in the US, UK and Canada,” he says. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, meanwhile, has kept up his outreach to the Sikhs. On December 26, he marked the first Veer Bal Diwas to commemorate the sacrifice of Guru Gobind Singh’s sons. Then, Darshan Dhaliwal, a US-based businessman deported in 2020-21 when he came to organize a langar during the farm agitation, was conferred the Pravasi Bharatiya Samman. For the state and the Centre, there are strategic considerations to consider, with pro-Khalistan militants seemingly lurking in the shadows. Somehow, events have kept that pot simmering: take the recent mystery deaths of terrorists Harvinder Singh Sandhu, alias Rinda, and Harpreet Singh, alias Happy Sanghera, in Pakistan and Italy respectively, and the arrest of Kulwinderjit Singh, alias Khanpuria, from Delhi airport in November. There are those like Sikh intellectual G.B.S. Sidhu who believe this churn can throw up something good for the future. It’s the present the government has to safeguard.Subscribe to India Today Magazine--- ENDS ---

It was not a surprise  that netizens went crazy to watch there favourite actress Nitanshi goel also known as Kpop princess with Korean singer Aoora ( who recently visited india for Kpop concerts in Mumbai and Jammu ) on a popular shopping platform Amazon . They both came live on Amazon to share tips on Kpop trends . There interaction in Korean  and Hindi won many hearts. We look forward to many such interactions and collaborations where Indo Korean celebrities can come together and share more about such cultural exchanges .

Nitanshi Goel was extremely excited with the response and mentioned-

There is a lot of exchange happening between India and Korea in terms of content consumption. We love their K-dramas and K-Pop and they also love our cinema and our culture.

My huge fan following in India and Korea is in fact, a major reason why I loves to style myself in both the looks. K-pop idols always share their appreciation towards their fans and find ways to interact with fans who’ve been supporting them since the beginning. It was great to meet K-POP singer Aoora through Amazon live. I am sure all my fans also loved him as much as I did .

Rohit Sharma hints at simulating English conditions ahead of WTC final India vs Australia: Captain Rohit Sharma hinted that the pitch for the 4th Test in Ahmedabad might be seamer-friendly as India look to prepare for the World Test Championship final, which will be played in London in June. India will take on Australia in the 3rd of the 4-Test series in Indore from Wednesday, March 1. AdvertisementIndia Today Sports DeskNew Delhi,UPDATED: Feb 28, 2023 19:05 ISTGreen pitch in Ahmedabad? Rohit hints India will rehearse for WTC final (PTI Photo)In ShortIndia and Australia will meet in the 3rd Test in Indore from WednesdayThe 4th Test will be played in Ahmedabad from March 9India need to win one of the remaining 2 Tests to reach the WTC finalBy India Today Sports Desk: India captain Rohit Sharma hinted on Tuesday that the pitch for the 4th and final Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia could have a green tinge as India are planning to simulate English conditions in the lead-up to the World Test Championship final. India are yet to secure their place in the WTC final, which will be held at the Oval in London. advertisementIndia need a 3-0 or a 3-1 result against Australia in the ongoing series to assure themselves of a place in the final of the World Test Championship for the second successive time. India lost to New Zealand in the final of the inaugural edition of the WTC in England in 2021. While stressing that their focus is on winning the 3rd Test, starting March 1 in Indore, Rohit Sharma said the team has already spoken about the chances of having a seamer-friendly pitch in the final Test in Ahmedabad. Notably, Australia are also favourites to reach the WTC final despite their horror show so far and playing against Australia on a green pitch will only aid the preparations for India. ""It will be a different ball game (facing Australia in England) for both teams, actually. There is definitely a possibility of that (Ahmedabad as preparatory game for WTC final). We have already spoken about it. We need to get the guys ready for it,"" Rohit said on the eve of the 3rd Test in Indore. ""The important one is Shardul Thakur, because he comes into the planning for us. We don't know how ready he is since he has just got married (laughs). We don't know how many overs he has bowled. But that thought process is definitely there.""If we get the result we want here (Indore), we might think of doing something different in Ahmedabad for sure.""But we are not there yet. We have to win this game and then talk about it. That'll be the right thing to do,"" he said.""You are never in on these wickets,"" he added. CHALLENGING HOME CONDITIONSFurthermore, Rohit Sharma said he is proud of the fact that India are on the cusp of reaching the World Test Championship final, talking up their dominance at home. India will win their 16th straight Test series at home if they manage to win one of the two remaining Tests against Australia. India hammered Australia by an innings and 132 runs in the first Test in Nagpur before dominating the visitors in the 2nd Test in Delhi for a 6-wicket win. Both Tests ended inside 2 days as Australia had no answers to the spin duo of R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja. advertisement""Yes there are home conditions but they are challenging conditions; it is not easy for the batters to score runs consistently,"" Rohit added. ""Yeah....that's the beauty of this game and the pitches we are playing on. It can happen to us as well, not just them. I played 200 balls in Nagpur and never felt set. It just takes one ball to grip or keep low and you are out. On pitches like this, you are never in.""Yes, we have quality spinners who can change things around just like that but that does not give us the guarantee that we are going to win the Test or roll them over in one session. We have got to keep the discipline going,"" he said.--- ENDS ---Also Read |  India vs Australia: KL Rahul's removal as vice-captain doesn't indicate anything, says Rohit Sharma

The Islamabad Police had registered a terrorism case against Khan and senior PTI leaders for allegedly vandalising state property in response to the Toshakhana case.The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) in October last year filed a case in an Islamabad-based banking court against Khan and other PTI leaders over allegedly receiving prohibited funding.The Election Commission of Pakistan last year found the party guilty of concealing that it had received the money and also disqualified Khan.The prohibited funding case was filed by estranged PTI founding member Akbar S Babar in the ECP in 2014.Khan has not attended any hearings since November last year when he was injured in an assassination attempt at his rally in the Wazirabad area of Punjab.Khan was granted interim bail by a special court in Islamabad after being shot during the assassination attempt.He has since received extensions on his bail due to medical reasons.Khan was ousted from power in April after losing a no-confidence vote in his leadership, which he alleged was part of a US-led conspiracy targeting him because of his independent foreign policy decisions on Russia, China, and Afghanistan.The PTI chief, who came to power in 2018, is the only Pakistani prime minister to be ousted in a no-confidence vote in Parliament.Start a ConversationFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIAFacebookTwitterInstagramKOO APPYOUTUBE Visual Stories  19 habits a good spouse should haveLifestyleRang Majha Vegla actress Anushka Pimputkar's purple saree photoshoot is all about elegancetvMuslim baby boy names with meaning from QuranLifestyleTejasswi Prakash stuns in a green shimmer dress;

The family of the martyred army man alleged that his father was thrashed for building a memorial for his son on government land in Jandaha in Bihar`s Vaishali. At least 20 Indian Army personnel, including a Colonel, were killed in the clash with Chinese troops in the Galwan Valley on the intervening night of June 15-16, the biggest military confrontation in over five decades that has significantly escalated the already volatile border standoff between the two countries.
The jawan whose father was targeted was identified as Jai Kishore Singh. However, the police claimed that the matter is linked to an issue of illegal encroachment, which was in violation of the rights of the landowner.

""On January 23, a case was registered under SC/ST Act over a statue being erected on the land of Hari Nath Ram & on govt land in Jandaha. Later, walls bordering the statue were built. They have not sought any permission. If they wanted, they could have made it in their own land or sought land from the government. There would not have been an issue then. The landowner`s rights being violated due to illegal encroachment,"" the SDPO Mahua said.

India NewsPress Trust of IndiaUpdated: February 28, 2023 7:22 pm ISTThe ministers on Tuesday tendered their resignations to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal.New Delhi: The BJP on Tuesday described AAP as a party of ""cut, commission and corruption"" and said its leaders Manish Sisodia and Satyendar Jain should have resigned from the Cabinet much earlier when the graft allegations against them had come to light.Deputy Chief Minister Sisodia was arrested by the CBI on Sunday evening in connection with alleged corruption in the formulation and implementation of the now-scrapped Delhi liquor policy for 2021-22, while Jain is lodged in Tihar Jail in a money laundering case since May last year.The ministers on Tuesday tendered their resignations to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, which has been accepted.Hitting out at the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and its national convener Mr Kejriwal, senior BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad said people who claimed to be the ""flag bearers of the fight against corruption"" have ensured governance that ""increases the number of alcohol users in Delhi"".Without naming any party, Mr Prasad said he thought cut and the commission was the legacy of only one political party.""But today, I must say that 3C-cut, commission, and corruption also applies to Mr Kejriwal's party,"" Mr Prasad said and added that AAP leaders have defamed the anti-corruption agitation led by Anna Hazare.""They should have resigned earlier. Mr Jain has resigned several months after his arrest and Mr Sisodia should have resigned at the time when the allegations against them came out,"" the former law minister said while addressing a press conference here.Describing the liquor scam case in Delhi as a ""fixed textbook case of corruption"", Mr Prasad said the BJP will raise the issue in every corner of the country.He said the Supreme court on Tuesday refused to ""grant any indulgence to one of the ""most prominent faces of the anti-corruption movement led by Anna Hazare"".  ""This clearly indicates the merit of Sisodia's plea that the Supreme Court refused to grant any relief,"" Mr Prasad said.The Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to entertain the bail plea of Mr Sisodia, who is in CBI custody in connection with the excise policy case.Mr Sisodia is perhaps the only education minister in the country who is also a ""liquor minister"", the BJP leader said.On Arvind Kejriwal, Mr Prasad said that during the Gujarat elections, he claimed that the Intelligence Bureau was reporting a big win for the AAP, and on Monday, he claimed that the CBI was not in favour of Sisodia's arrest.PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com""I am amazed at the number of lies spewed by Mr Kejriwal for the commission from liquor,"" he said.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)Featured Video Of The DayOn Camera, Bihar Cops Drag, Arrest Father Of Soldier Who Died In GalwanTrack Latest News Live on NDTV.com and get news updates from India  and around the world.

Now protect the EV with electric vehicle InsuranceDaily direct flight to Shirdi from VijFree bus service from Ratham centre to hill topThe Andhra Pradesh CM said that he will win all the 175 seats as he has trust in the public. TENALI (GUNTUR): Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy on Tuesday dared TDP supremo Chandrababu Naidu and Janasena chief Pawan Kalyan to contest in all the 175 assembly constituencies in the state if they have guts to face the public.He said that he is going ""to win all the 175 seats"" as he has trust in the public and blessings of God. He appealed to people to extend their support to him only if they benefited during his rule. The chief minister released the financial assistance to the farmers under YSR Rythu Bharosa-PM Kisan in Tenali in Guntur district on Tuesday. He transferred nearly Rs 1,090 crore into the accounts of over 52 lakh farmers under the scheme. The CM had also disbursed the input subsidy Rs 77 crore to about 90,000 farmers who lost the crop due to the Mandous cyclone.Addressing a public meeting held in the agriculture market yard premises, the chief minister lashed out at opposition parties for deliberately misleading the people with the support of their own media houses. He said that Naidu depended on a poisonous campaign and he had no courage to seek votes on the schemes and projects taken up during his regime. “We have done good to each and every family in the last four years. We have kept all of our promises. In contrast, your son (referring to himself) has courage to seek votes based on his performance,” claimed Jagan. He said that they have distributed over Rs 27,000 crore to the farmers giving nearly Rs 54,000 financial assistance to each farmer in the last four years. “The state will prosper only when the farmer is happy. There is no drought in the last four years since your son (Jagan) took over the reins of the state. The state reeled under severe drought conditions throughout the five-year rule under Naidu,” said the CM. He said that Naidu was synonymous with drought whenever he headed the state.He said that next elections would be held between the party (YSRCP), which modernized the schools for the better future of the children from poor families, and the party (referring to TDP) which opposed the development of the schools. He said that it would be a battle between the party (YSRCP) which took the sides of the poor and the party which backed the corporate firms. He said that there would be a tussle between the party which took healthcare to the villages in a span of just four years and the party which had completely neglected the public healthcare system.Jagan wanted the people to see the difference between the TDP and YSRCP regime and extend their support to them to continue the empowerment of the weaker sections in all spheres. He lashed out at Naidu for opposing the grant of house-sites to the poor as he was unable to digest the initiative of YSRCP government. He said that Naidu could not implement the welfare schemes initiated by YSRCP government as he was never a pro-poor leader. He termed TDP as Tinuko (Eat)-Dochuko(Loot)-Panchuko (Distribute among the gang) as it had looted the public monies for the benefit of Naidu’s coterie. He said that they have disbursed over Rs 2.2 lakh crore through DBT to the poor through various welfare schemes in a transparent mode of distribution.Jagan exuded confidence that he would return to power in the next elections with the backing of people and God.Start a ConversationFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIAFacebookTwitterInstagramKOO APPYOUTUBE Visual Stories  Krishna Mukherjee’s classy beachwear collectiontvSteal worthy attires from Jasmin Bhasin's wardrobe for Holi Party 2023EntertainmentDiljit Dosanjh's 8-ingredient desi chai is the best way to begin the dayFood10 Bollywood celebs who no longer eat meatLifestyleAlaya F wows the internet in a stylish bikiniindiaHot makeup looks of Mrunal ThakurLifestyle11 times Malaika Arora proved she is the queen of fashionEntertainmentA look at Imlie fame Seerat Kapoor's Cheeni-inspired outfitstvInteresting experiences in Punjab for the traveller in youtravel123ElectionsAssembly Elecetions 2023Elections 2023Nagaland Election ResultsMeghalaya Election ResultTripura Election ResultKarnataka Elections 2023Exit Polls 2023Tripura Exit PollsTop TrendingExit Polls 2023South Africa vs West IndiesPM Kisan SchemeManish SisodiaMumbai Train AccidentBihar Budget 2023 LiveTrending StoriesIn CityEntire WebsiteJagan Mohan Reddy dares Chandrababu Naidu, Pawan Kalyan to contest all 175 seats in Andhra Pradesh if they have gutsDGP appears before HC in contempt caseDaily direct flight to Shirdi from VijBihar budget 2023-24: Highlights13 years on, Baroda Cricket Association (BCA) realizes fugitive Lalit Modi is still its patronJoin this IISc course on Intelligent AutomationMIT xPRO’s COO ProgrammeProtect your EV with electric vehicle insuranceScoring above Covid: How these students from Delhi scripted a different tale10-year-old Gurgaon boy sodomised, killed; dumped in garbage yard30k in MP uploaded child abuse material; over 4,000 likely to be arrestedChinese foreign minister to visit India on sidelines of G20The man who taught Americans to cook Indian foodB'luru: Father hacked to death after son gives Rs 1cr supariRahul's removal as vice-captain indicates nothing: RohitNIA, ATS, Mumbai cops hunt for 'ultra' trained in China, PakWhy property as legacy for children is a bad ideaWhy are petrol prices still so high in India?Participate in the Times EdTech SurveyShould you opt for EPFO high pension scheme?About usCreate Your Own AdTerms of Use and Grievance Redressal Policy Privacy policyAdvertise with usRSSNewsletterFeedbackePaperSitemapArchivesFOLLOW US ONOther Times Group News SitesThe Economic TimesHindi Economic TimesNavbharat TimesMaharashtra TimesVijaya KarnatakaTelugu SamayamTamil SamayamMalayalam SamayamEi SamayI am GujaratTimesPointsIndiatimesBrand CapitalEducation TimesTimes FoodMiss KyraMumbai MirrorBangalore MirrorPopular CategoriesHeadlinesSports NewsBusiness NewsIndia NewsWorld NewsBollywood NewsHealth & Fitness TipsIndian TV ShowsCelebrity PhotosHot on the WebRashmika MandannaHrithik RoshanHoney RosesBollywood CouplesSouth Indian ActorShreyas IyerAbby Choi Murder CaseVastu TipsRakesh SujathasShehnaaz GillTop TrendsExit Polls 2023South Africa vs West IndiesPM Kisan SchemeManish SisodiaMumbai Train AccidentBihar Budget 2023 LiveLeh Ice Wall ClimbingDelhi Excise Policy CaseQin GangB S YediyurappaGautam AdaniCBSE Board Exam 2023Bank Holidays in MarchEPFO High PensionNagaland Election Exit PollsTripura Election ResultCryptocurrency Price in IndiaIPL Schedule 2023Trending TopicsParineeti ChopraParenting TipsRelationships TipsShark Tank India 2Rich Dosa RecipesGondola Rides In VeniceOld FridgeMushroom BenefitsSAG Awards 2023Heart DiseasesBest Food For HealthGenelia D'SouzaBollywood Actor TransformationsShanthi PriyaAlia BhattBollywood CelebritiesVivo Y55sLaptops under 30000WiFi RoutersTablets under 15000Living and entertainmentiDivaMensXP.comFeminaETimesGraziaZoomTravel DestinationsBombay TimesCricbuzz.comFilmfareOnline SongsTVLifestyleLongwalks AppNewspaper SubscriptionFood NewsTimes PrimeWhats HotServicesCouponDuniaMagicbricksTechGigTimesJobsBollywood NewsTimes MobileGadgets NowCareersColombiaCopyright © 2023 Bennett, Coleman & Co.

Looks like the richest man in the world has a replacement in mind already.AdvertisementSneha SahaNew Delhi,UPDATED: Feb 28, 2023 19:09 ISTIn ShortElon Musk fired Parag Agrawal as soon as he acquired Twitter.Musk acquired Twitter for $44 billion.Musk plans to step down from Twitter CEO position later this year.By Sneha Saha: Elon Musk fired Parag Agrawal as soon as he acquired Twitter for $44 billion last year and became the new CEO. But, Musk plans to step down from the CEO's position by the end of this year, he confirmed during a recent interview. Now the question is – if Musk steps down from the Twitter CEO position, who will be the head of Twitter next? Looks like the richest man in the world has a replacement in mind already and he is an insider.advertisementAccording to reports, Musk may announce Steve Davis, who is the CEO of The Boring Company, as the next Twitter CEO very soon. For the unaware, Davis has long been an associate of Musk and knows how the billionaire works. In one of his tweets, Musk also said that he would appoint a new Twitter CEO but continue to have the power in his hands. It is highly likely that Musk will bring someone he knows and has worked with closely, as the new Twitter CEO.Going by a recent report from Platformer, Davis worked for Twitter as a part of Musk’s transition team last year. The billionaire reportedly tasked Davis to cut USD 500 million in costs but he ended up cutting around USD 1 billion. ""His success in bringing costs down by any means necessary has led to growing speculation internally that Musk will choose him to be Twitter's next CEO,"" the report stated.Davis has been a part of Musk’s core Twitter team since his takeover and was also responsible for the recent changes as well as layoffs. The company recently fired 200 employees, which is about 10 per cent of the workforce, and it is said that Davis has a key role to play in it. While Musk hasn’t revealed many details about the latest layoffs, reports suggest that product managers, engineers, and people in data science have been impacted the most. In fact, Musk also fired Esther Crawford, who was heading projects such as Blue verification subscription and the upcoming payments platform. Additionally, Chris Reidy, who was the acting Twitter head of sales, was also asked to leave during the latest round of layoffs.Musk fired over 50 per cent of the workforce as soon as he acquired Twitter last year. Following the harsh layoffs came many more rounds of job cuts and later Musk promised not to cut any more jobs at the firm. Looks like the current Twitter CEO isn’t living up to his words and firing employees at regular intervals. In India too, Musk has laid off hundreds of employees in the last few months. In fact, some reports suggest that Musk has shut down two out of three offices in India to cut costs.Now, we will have to wait to see who officially becomes the next Twitter CEO.--- ENDS ---Also read |  Motorola Rizr rollable concept first impressions: This is mind-blowingAlso read |  Oppo Find N2 first impressions: The handy foldable

When someone asked her about Rakhi, she pledged her support for the actress and shared how she missed her and will do anything to get her out of the trouble she is going through currently because of her husband Adil Durrani. She said, ""Rakhi and I have been frenemies. I have known her because of Bigg Boss. Her entire issue with Adil is her personal issue and I would not want to get into it, but I am here to support her. I call her a frenemy because we have even fought equally many times. But if she is going through a crisis, then however she is or whatever people speak about her, I will always be there for her.""At the same party, Kashmera was spotted indulging in PDA with husband Krushna and netizens commented on it. Ask her about it and she says, ""Yes, I know people thought I was heavily drunk and therefore could not stand properly. The real reason was I was jetlagged. I had just returned from LA, reached home and then went to the party, so I could barely stand. I did have a glass of wine so if that made me tipsy, I wouldn't know. Yes I was pulling my husband towards me and indulging in PDA because I had not met him for a long time. It was almost 3 weeks and I missed him very much. I was PDA-starved and that's why I kissed Krushna at the party publicly. I was also missing my kids. Next, we are planning to go to LA again soon for a holiday.""End of the articleVisual StoriesRight arrowEntertainmentMarathi actresses who stunned in a floral outfitsLife Style19 habits a good spouse should haveTVRang Majha Vegla actress Anushka Pimputkar's purple saree photoshoot is all about eleganceLife StyleMuslim baby boy names with meaning from QuranTVTejasswi Prakash stuns in a green shimmer dress; her party looksEntertainment10 Pics Proving Urvashi Rautela Is An Amazing FashionistaLife StyleInside Shah Rukh Khan’s LA homeTravelScenic hiking trails in India for the spring seasonPhotosChitrangda Singh can slay any look and these pictures are a proofEntertainmentSree Vishnu's best onscreen heroinesSponsored StoriesGolden Truth: Eight Things to Know Before Buying Gold SUBSCRIBE NOWGet a weekly dose of all the major happenings in the TV world, right in your inbox every Friday.SubscribeBy subscribing to newsletter, you acknowledge our privacy policyThanks for subscribing.Please Click Here to subscribe other newsletters that may interest you, and you'll always find stories you want to read in your inbox.Featured in TVTejasswi Prakash sports a bold look; in picsSumbul Touqeer's interesting journey in showbizTejasswi Prakash stuns in a green shimmer dressRandeep on bagging the lead role in BALH2Sambhavna on surrogacy, failed IVF attemptsRakhi: Adil told Iranian girl he'd marry herKrishna Mukherjee’s beachwear collectionSumbul, Fahmaan miss their Imlie daysPICS: Urfi Javed's massive transformationPhotogalleryChitrangda Singh can slay any look and these pictures are a proofAmyra Dastur teases fans with her glamorous picturesKhushi Kapoor sets hearts racing with her bewitching photosAlaya F wows the internet in a stylish bikiniKim Kardashian's iconic Dolce & Gabbana looksFrom Rashmika Mandanna to Mira Rajput, best celebrity paparazzi pictures of the dayShilpa Shetty channels her inner 'apsara' in sheer white sareeLiza Golden-Bhojwani channels her inner diva during the photoshootRashmika Mandanna stuns in off-shoulder dressLATEST VIDEOSNewsShiv Thakare on his Bigg Boss 16 moments: I loved Mandali outfits during finale performance10:41Alibaba's Abhishek Nigam: I have come to the palace to keep an eye on Marjina in a new look01:43Dil Diyaan Gallan: Amrita’s special request to Veer, hold his hand01:39Bhagya Lakshmi on location: Rishi comes to Lakshmi’s rescue01:57Asim Riaz slams 'Bigg Boss 13' makers for not letting him win, fans react01:45Aishwarya Khare and Rohit Suchanti’s love for horror movies, ghar ka khaana & more02:33‘What’s in my bag’ ft.

The hot test was carried out for a planned duration of 25 seconds at the High Altitude Test Facility of the ISRO Propulsion Complex at Mahendragiri in Tamil Nadu on February 24, the Bengaluru-headquartered national space agency said.

""All the propulsion parameters during the test were found satisfactory and closely matched with predictions,"" an ISRO statement said on Monday.

The cryogenic engine will be further integrated with the propellant tanks, stage structures and associated fluid lines to realise the fully-integrated flight cryogenic stage, ISRO said.

Earlier this year, Chandrayaan-3 lander successfully underwent EMI/EMC test at U R Rao Satellite Centre here.

EMI-EMC (Electro - Magnetic Interference/ Electro - Magnetic Compatibility) test is conducted for satellite missions to ensure the functionality of the satellite subsystems in the space environment and their compatibility with the expected electromagnetic levels, it was noted.

""This test is a major milestone in the realisation of the satellites,"" ISRO had said.

Chandrayaan-3 interplanetary mission has three major modules: the propulsion module, lander module, and a rover. The mission's complexity calls for establishing radio-frequency (RF) communication links between the modules.
During the Chandrayaan-3 lander EMI/EC test, launcher compatibility, antenna polarisation of all RF systems, standalone auto compatibility tests for orbital and powered descent mission phases, and lander and rover compatibility tests for post landing mission phase were ensured, according to ISRO.

Chandrayaan-3 is a follow-on mission to Chandrayaan-2 to demonstrate end-to-end capability in safe landing and roving on the lunar surface. ISRO plans to launch the mission in June.

It will be launched by Launch Vehicle Mark 3 (LVM3) from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota (Andhra Pradesh).

The propulsion module will carry the lander and rover configuration till 100 km lunar orbit. The propulsion module has Spectro-polarimetry of Habitable Planet Earth (SHAPE) payload to study the spectral and polari metric measurements of Earth from the lunar orbit.Live TvChandrayaan-3 MissionISROchandrayaan 3 missionChandrayaan 3ChandrayaanMore Stories Manish Sisodia Quits Sisodia Resigns As Delhi Deputy CM, Satyendar Jain Too Quits As Minister Bill Gates Bill Gates Visits RBI HQ In Mumbai; Meets Governor ShaktiKanta Das  Gurugram Men Riding Luxury Car Allegedly Steal Flower Pots From G20 Event in Gurugram snap Snap Joins AI Race; Announces To Integrate OpenAI's ChatGPT With Platform manish sisodia arrest Delhi Excise Policy Case: Manish Sisodia Resigns As Deputy Delhi CM India vs Australia 2023 LIVE Updates | IND VS AUS 3rd Test, Day 1 Cricket Match Live Score Ben stokes I’m Not Going To Lie...: Ben Stokes Opens Up On His Availability For CSK KL Rahul Rohit Sharma REVEALS Real Reason Behind Removing KL Rahul As Vice CaptainComments - Join the DiscussionTrending newsDNA VideoDNA: Famous writer Anant Pai passed away on this day in the year 2011DNA VideoDNA: For the first time in the year 1886, Aluminum was made in the laboratoryDNA VideoDNA: When India's first education minister Abul Kalam Azad died in 1958DNA VideoDNA: When will the Russia-Ukraine war end?DNA VideoDNA: Fear of corona infection, Home becomes 'Jail'

(Photo: Facebook)By Shilpi Sen: Days after Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said he would end the rule of mafias in the state, state minister JPS Rathore said the government has started the process to eliminate criminals. The statement comes a day after Arbaz, one of the accused in the Umesh Pal murder case, was killed in an encounter with police in Prayagraj. Umesh Pal, a prime witness to the 2005 murder of BSP MLA Raju Pal, was earlier shot dead by assailants outside his residence. advertisement""The chief minister said in the Assembly that we will turn criminals to dust. The process has begun. We have started taking strict action against criminals. We will not spare any criminal, nor will we tolerate any crime in Uttar Pradesh,"" said Rathore.

The police said the car in which Dubey was travelling flipped and he snatched a policeman's gun, tried to escape and opened fire before they shot him.Also Read | Plot hatched in Bareilly jail, attackers met in hostel: How Umesh Pal's murder was executedOn the Samajwadi Party tweeting a photo of Sadaqat Khan -- the key accused in the Umesh Pal murder case -- with Udaybhan Karwariya--the husband of a BJP leader, Rathore said action will be taken against whoever is guilty. ""Be it a member of any party, we will not spare anyone.""The media cell of the Samajwadi party shared a photo alleging Sadaqat was currently a member of BJP, who is being linked with the Samajwadi Party.

According to Mumbai Police officials, ""A search for the ''dangerous'' man has been launched after an e-mail was received from the city unit of NIA about his suspicious movements.

""The e-mail from the NIA was received on Sunday afternoon, following which all agencies were put on alert. The NIA communication identified the suspect as Sarfaraz Memon who it said had entered Mumbai, the official said, adding that as Memon hails from Madhya Pradesh, the police in that state have also been alerted.
""While informing about the suspect, NIA officials also shared details like an Aadhaar card, a driving license and a passport. As per information received, the suspect has received training in China, Hong Kong, and Pakistan,"" the police official said.

In its communication, the NIA reportedly warned that his man could pose a serious threat to Mumbai`s law and order situation. The central anti-terror agency, which is tracking him, said that Memon had reached Mumbai and advised the city police to be more vigilant as he is an ""enemy of the state"".

A senior Mumbai Police officer later confirmed that an e-mail was received from the NIA and a search is on for the man, according to news agency PTI. Based on the communication received from the NIA, the Mumbai Police has now sought more information about the “dangerous” man from Indore Police.

It may be recalled that in the past couple of months, the Mumbai Police have received several threats of possible terror strikes, but all proved to be hoaxes.Live TvPak-Trained Dangerous ManNIASarfaraz MemonMumbai PoliceIndoreMadhya PradeshHigh alertMumbai newsPakistanMore Stories Manish Sisodia Quits Sisodia Resigns As Delhi Deputy CM, Satyendar Jain Too Quits As Minister Bill Gates Bill Gates Visits RBI HQ In Mumbai; Meets Governor ShaktiKanta Das  Gurugram Men Riding Luxury Car Allegedly Steal Flower Pots From G20 Event in Gurugram snap Snap Joins AI Race; Announces To Integrate OpenAI's ChatGPT With Platform manish sisodia arrest Delhi Excise Policy Case: Manish Sisodia Resigns As Deputy Delhi CM India vs Australia 2023 LIVE Updates | IND VS AUS 3rd Test, Day 1 Cricket Match Live Score Ben stokes I’m Not Going To Lie...: Ben Stokes Opens Up On His Availability For CSK KL Rahul Rohit Sharma REVEALS Real Reason Behind Removing KL Rahul As Vice CaptainComments - Join the DiscussionTrending newsDNA VideoDNA: Famous writer Anant Pai passed away on this day in the year 2011DNA VideoDNA: For the first time in the year 1886, Aluminum was made in the laboratoryDNA VideoDNA: When India's first education minister Abul Kalam Azad died in 1958DNA VideoDNA: When will the Russia-Ukraine war end?DNA VideoDNA: Fear of corona infection, Home becomes 'Jail'

Sadaqat Khan is one of the key conspirators of the case and has been arrested by UP Police's Special Task Force (STF). advertisementThe details regarding the plot and the meeting emerged a day after an accused in the Umesh Pal murder case was killed in an encounter in UP's Prayagraj. The plan to kill Umesh Pal was hatched after the assailants met Atiq Ahmed's brother Ashraf, who is lodged in a jail in Bareilly. The accused worked on the details of the conspiracy to kill Umesh Pal in a ""room of a Muslim hostel"", the commissioner of police said.Atiq Ahmed, who is currently lodged in Sabarmati jail, gave instructions to murder Umesh Pal, said the sources.

Interestingly, Atiq Ahmed was earlier lodged in Bareilly jail too. Among the most sensational murders in which Atiq Ahmed is allegedly involved was that of Raju Pal. Meanwhile, the security around the barracks where former MLA Ashraf is lodged has been tightened and security agencies are on alert. Sources have said Ashraf and other prisoners may be shifted to another jail.

Pros and Cons explainedBought an EV? Now protect the EV with electric vehicle Insurance2023 Triumph Street Triple 765 range launch next month: Booking amount, specs, featuresHonda CB350 cafe racer India launch soon: Specs, features, expected priceHonda Motorcycle and Scooter India (HMSI) recently launched the 2023 Honda Activa 6G with a top-end variant, called the ‘H-Smart’. The newly introduced H-Smart sits at the top of the Activa line-up mainly because it offers a car-like Smart Key that enables features such as vehicle location, smart lock-unlock and start-stop. However, the sequence in which the key is operated and the scooter is turned on, seems to be off-putting for several TOI Auto readers. First, lets take a look at the 2023 Honda Activa H-Smart start-up sequence.2023 Honda Activa 6G, How to operate H-Smart Key | TOI AutoSo as we just saw, to operate the H-Smart system, we first need to unlock the scooter by pressing on the key fob button for approximately 5 seconds, once the green light comes on the key fob, the scooter is ready to be started. After this point, a user has to rotate the ignition dial onboard the scooter to the on position, after which, we pull on the left brake handle and press the ignition button to make the scooter come to life. The startup sequence can be perceived to be cumbersome and TOI Auto followers seem to share the same opinion, based on the comments that have been left on a short video shared on our social platforms. One user asked, “This has only increased the time to start! How is it better?”, another said, “Why does it remind me of a washing machine.” One user even took a shot at Honda by saying, “All new Prestige Activa Burner with laughing and heart emoji - seriously regulator?”.2023 Activa smart key and knobThe one big con:So with the 2023 Activa’s current H-Smart system, the cons seem to be quite clear. The system has turned the sequence of hopping on to your scooter, turning a key and riding off a bit more complicated. One would now have to strategically unlock the scooter which only reads the key within 2 metres of proximity and then make an added effort before starting a journey. Ultimately, it relies on changing user behaviour which is not an easy thing to do in the grander scale of things.Screenshots from Instagram/timesofindia.autoThe pros:However, the H-Smart technology is undoubtedly the beginning of next generation smart and safety features in the economical scooter segment. It offers segment-first features such as Smart Find, that allows a scooter to be located when within range via an audible alert. Smart Safe anti-theft system that will not allow ignition unless the key is within 2 metres of the scooter and then there is the added layer of security with the remote based smart on-off and lock-unlock.2023 Honda Activa H-SmartIn the end, like any new technology, Honda’s H-Smart system can be expected to become more sophisticated and streamlined over time. While the added security may feel cumbersome at first, it does go a long way in protecting your investment of Rs 80,537 ex-showroom that one has to pay for the top-end model. Ultimately, what a buyer will have to decide is wether a quick unlock sequence is more important than an added layer of security for their scooter. What will you prefer? Tell us in the comments.

The probe will be led by Lakhmi Gautam, joint commissioner of police, Mumbai Crime Branch. Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime Branch) Krishnakant Upadhyay and Assistant Commissioner of Police Jai Prakash Bhosale are also part of the team, Mumbai Police said.

""The suicide case of an 18-year-old student of IIT Bombay transferred to SIT Crime Branch. Jt Commissioner of Police (crime) Lakhmi Gautam to lead the team. The student had jumped off the 7th floor of his hostel earlier this month. His family had alleged caste-based harassment,"" Mumbai Police said in a statement. On February 12, the student, identified as 18-year-old Darshan Solanki jumped to his death from the seventh floor of his hostel.

Powai police registered an Accidental Death Report (ADR) in the matter and launched further investigation. Hailing from Ahmedabad, Darshan was pursuing BTech at the IIT Bombay in Mumbai. As soon as the information about the suicide was received, the police reached the spot and took him to the hospital where the doctors declared him dead. On February 13, Darshan`s family claimed that he faced caste discrimination at IIT Bombay and they suspected some foul play behind his death. Later, his family demanded a probe by a Special Investigation Team (SIT).

On the day Darshan died, IIT Bombay issued a statement strongly refuting news reports that said the first-year B-Tech student was subjected to caste discrimination.""It is wrong to make such accusations when the police are still investigating the case. Based on initial inputs from friends, there is no indication that the student faced any such discrimination. We request that such unfounded allegations not be spread,"" the institute said in the statement. Solanki, Darshan`s father, speaking to ANI, claimed that his son could not have taken his own life.
""He must have been harassed and I fear that he was killed,"" he added. He alleged that darshan had complained about caste discrimination, but no one paid heed. Darshan`s sister Jahnvi also said the family is ""100 percent sure that he was murdered"".""First, they told us that Darshan met with an accident When our relatives reached Mumbai, they were told that he fell down the stairs. Later, we were told that he jumped off the 7th floor of his hostel.

How can there be three different versions of his death?"" Jahnvi said. She said some students might have hit him on the head, which resulted in his death.""We are 100 percent sure he was murdered,"" she said, claiming that the police and the IIT Bombay management were making up a suicide story to shield the culprits. Live TvIIT Bombayiit bombay accidentAccident newsaccidental death reportfoul playMore Stories Manish Sisodia Quits Sisodia Resigns As Delhi Deputy CM, Satyendar Jain Too Quits As Minister Bill Gates Bill Gates Visits RBI HQ In Mumbai; Meets Governor ShaktiKanta Das  Gurugram Men Riding Luxury Car Allegedly Steal Flower Pots From G20 Event in Gurugram snap Snap Joins AI Race; Announces To Integrate OpenAI's ChatGPT With Platform manish sisodia arrest Delhi Excise Policy Case: Manish Sisodia Resigns As Deputy Delhi CM India vs Australia 2023 LIVE Updates | IND VS AUS 3rd Test, Day 1 Cricket Match Live Score Ben stokes I’m Not Going To Lie...: Ben Stokes Opens Up On His Availability For CSK KL Rahul Rohit Sharma REVEALS Real Reason Behind Removing KL Rahul As Vice CaptainComments - Join the DiscussionTrending newsDNA VideoDNA: Famous writer Anant Pai passed away on this day in the year 2011DNA VideoDNA: For the first time in the year 1886, Aluminum was made in the laboratoryDNA VideoDNA: When India's first education minister Abul Kalam Azad died in 1958DNA VideoDNA: When will the Russia-Ukraine war end?DNA VideoDNA: Fear of corona infection, Home becomes 'Jail'

The AAP government in Punjab had moved the Supreme Court after the Governor said he would seek legal advice over the summoning of the Assembly.  AdvertisementIndia Today News DeskNew Delhi,UPDATED: Feb 28, 2023 19:34 ISTThe AAP government led by CM Bhagwant Mann has had a series of run-ins with Governor Banwarilal Purohit.By India Today News Desk: After a standoff with the state government, Punjab Governor Banwarilal Purohit told the Supreme Court on Tuesday that he had summoned the Assembly on March 3 for the budget session. The tussle between the Punjab government and the Governor on summoning of the budget session had reached the Supreme Court on Monday. The Supreme Court said the governor had no discretion to delay the summoning of the state Assembly in contravention of the advice of ministers headed by the chief minister.advertisementThe Supreme Court disposed of the plea and told the state government and the governor that constitutional discourse has to be conducted with a ""sense of decorum and mature statesmanship"".""While this court is cognisant of free speech and expression, constitutional discourse has to be conducted with a sense of decorum and mature statesmanship, particularly in the context of constitutional dialogue between functionaries,"" a bench led by Chief Justice DY Chandrachud said. The Supreme Court bench took note of the submission of Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for Governor Banwarlial Purohit, that the plea of the Punjab government became infructuous in view of the Governor's decision to convene the Assembly.Through Additional Advocate General Shadan Farasat, the AAP government in Punjab approached the Supreme Court on Monday by moving a writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution. The Punjab government appealed to the Supreme Court to issue directions to the principal secretary of Governor to summon the budget session that is scheduled for March 3. ALSO READ: Tussle between Governor and Punjab govt over budget session reaches Supreme CourtThe Punjab government had also appealed to the Supreme Court to issue a declaration that the governor was bound to act on the aid and advice of the council of ministers in regard to summoning of assembly sessions.Last week, governor Banwarilal Purohit refused to summon the budget session, saying that he wanted legal advice on Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann's ""extremely derogatory and patently unconstitutional tweets"".The Supreme Court also expressed its displeasure over Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann's derogatory tweet.Senior advocate AM Singhvi, appearing for the Punjab government, alleged that Governor Banwarilal Purohit was hijacking the Constitution. ""A constitutional authority is acting in ignorance of the Constitution. He is hijacking the Constitution,"" Singhvi said.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told the Supreme Court that the plea filed by the Punjab government had become infructuous. ""The governor never refused (to summon the Assembly) and he said he is taking legal advice,"" Mehta said.""Political differences in a democratic polity are acceptable and have to be worked out with sobriety. Unless these principles were borne in mind, the effective implementation of constitutional values is liable to be placed in jeopardy,"" the Supreme Court bench said.--- ENDS ---

India NewsReported by Sunil PrabhuUpdated: February 28, 2023 7:30 pm ISTThere are now five ministers in the Delhi cabinet, including Arvind Kejriwal.New Delhi: Manish Sisodia and Satyendar Jain, arrested Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) ministers, quit the Delhi cabinet today. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal accepted their resignations and reassigned their ministries.The resignations were not an acceptance of guilt in any way, AAP asserted, describing it as an ""administrative step"". No new ministers will join the cabinet, party sources said, at least till the Delhi Budget next month.Manish Sisodia's departments were assigned to ministers Kailash Gahlot and Raj Kumar Anand.Manish Sisodia was arrested on Sunday over allegations of corruption in the Delhi liquor policy case. Before his arrest, he predicted that he would be in jail for ""7-8 months"".""I am stepping away till the charges against me are proven false,"" Mr Sisodia wrote in his resignation letter, sent shortly after the Supreme Court refused to entertain his petition challenging his arrest and urged him to approach a lower court first.""There are likely to be more cases against me... God knows these allegations are false.""The Deputy Chief Minister of Delhi had been in charge of 18 ministries, including the health portfolio of Satyendar Jain, who has been in jail for 10 months. Mr Sisodia said he had served Delhi for eight years ""with full dedication"".The resignations came soon after the BJP questioned why the arrested ministers were still in the Delhi government.There are now five ministers in the Delhi cabinet, including Mr Kejriwal, who has not taken any ministry, preferring instead to pursue AAP's national plans.Mr Sisodia, widely seen to be Mr Kejriwal's number two in the party and the government, had taken charge of a bulk of the ministries, leaving the AAP chief free to focus on the party's campaign across the country.When Satyendar Jain was arrested in May over allegations of money laundering, Mr Kejriwal simply transferred his departments to Mr Sisodia. Mr Jain held on to his job despite being in jail.But AAP sources said with Mr Sisodia's arrest the Delhi government has a vacuum in key portfolios like finance, health and education.PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.comMr Kejriwal may be forced to cut back on his trips to other states and take charge of some ministries. It is a huge setback for AAP as it preps for the 2024 national election. The Chief Minister had reportedly planned to visit states like Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, where elections will be held later this year.As for Delhi, it will need a Finance Minister to present the budget.Also ReadRead Manish Sisodia's Resignation Letter To Arvind Kejriwal""Stepping Away Till...,"" Writes Manish Sisodia In Resignation LetterManish Sisodia's 18 Departments To Be Distributed Among These 2 MinistersTrack Latest News Live on NDTV.com and get news updates from India  and around the world.

— ShivSena - शिवसेना Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray (@ShivSenaUBT_) February 27, 2023

The Shiv Sena (UBT) leader stated that the poll body should not have given its decision on the party name and symbol when hearings connected to it were underway in the Supreme Court.

He said the EC had given a symbol each to Rashtriya Lok Janshakti Party factions headed by party founder late Ram Vilas Paswan's son Chirag and Paswan's brother Pashupati Kumar Paras in a dispute similar to the one in the Shiv Sena. 

However, both factions are quiet over it as they are with the ruling Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP), Thackeray added.

Eknath Shinde and his supporters are 'creepers': Uddhav Thackeray 
Uddhav Thackeray also attacked Eknath Shinde and his supporters and said that they were ""creepers"" who had started thinking of themselves as the host tree.
Those who don't have values resort to stealing, Thackeray said in an apparent dig at the Shinde group.

Shinde had rebelled against Thackeray in June last year, which split the Shiv Sena and brought down the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, which also comprised Sharad Pawar's Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Congress.

Meanwhile, Shiv Sena (UBT) leader and Lok Sabha MP Rajan Vichare on Monday said that functionaries of the Eknath Shinde-led faction had usurped a 'shakha' (local office) that had been for running in Thane for several years when the party was undivided.

Despite an undertaking in the Supreme Court and public statements by Chief Minister Shinde that he or his supporters are not keen to lay claim on Sena properties, 'shakhas' were being grabbed, Vichare alleged.
The Lokmanya Nagar 'shakha' has been taken over by Shinde's supporters by force, he claimed.

Since the EC -- earlier this month -- recognised the Shinde group as the real Shiv Sena, there has been speculation over the ownership of the undivided party's properties, including the local offices where the cadre assemble through the day.Live TvUddhav ThackerayECEknath ShindeShiv SenaElection CommissionMore Stories Manish Sisodia Quits Sisodia Resigns As Delhi Deputy CM, Satyendar Jain Too Quits As Minister Bill Gates Bill Gates Visits RBI HQ In Mumbai; Meets Governor ShaktiKanta Das  Gurugram Men Riding Luxury Car Allegedly Steal Flower Pots From G20 Event in Gurugram snap Snap Joins AI Race; Announces To Integrate OpenAI's ChatGPT With Platform manish sisodia arrest Delhi Excise Policy Case: Manish Sisodia Resigns As Deputy Delhi CM India vs Australia 2023 LIVE Updates | IND VS AUS 3rd Test, Day 1 Cricket Match Live Score Ben stokes I’m Not Going To Lie...: Ben Stokes Opens Up On His Availability For CSK KL Rahul Rohit Sharma REVEALS Real Reason Behind Removing KL Rahul As Vice CaptainComments - Join the DiscussionTrending newsDNA VideoDNA: Famous writer Anant Pai passed away on this day in the year 2011DNA VideoDNA: For the first time in the year 1886, Aluminum was made in the laboratoryDNA VideoDNA: When India's first education minister Abul Kalam Azad died in 1958DNA VideoDNA: When will the Russia-Ukraine war end?DNA VideoDNA: Fear of corona infection, Home becomes 'Jail'

This policy was made to exploit money so that they can fight elections with Khalistani's help,"" Gambhir was quoted as saying by ANI.

""If there was no discrepancy in liquor policy, it shouldn't have been taken back. This is not the time to give emotional statements. If he (Sisodia) has opened schools, colleges, and hospitals, show it to us. He can move to SC, but for me, Delhi CM (Arvind Kejriwal) and AAP have been exposed,"" the cricketer-turned-politician added.

Earlier in the day, Sisodia moved the Supreme Court seeking bail in the excise policy case.

A bench headed by Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud took note of the submissions of senior advocate A M Singhvi, appearing for Sisodia who is presently in CBI's custody, and agreed to hear the plea today itself at 3.50 PM.

The top court initially observed that the jailed Aam Aadmi Party leader has remedies under the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) to move the Delhi High Court for bail and seeking the quashing of the FIR.
A special Delhi court on Monday sent Sisodia to five-day CBI remand in the excise policy case to allow the agency to get ""genuine and legitimate"" answers to questions being put to him for ""a proper and fair investigation"".

The CBI on Sunday evening had arrested Sisodia in connection with alleged corruption in the formulation and implementation of the now-scrapped liquor policy for 2021-22.Live TvGautam GambhirManish SisodiaBJPAAPCBIdelhi excise policy scamMore Stories Manish Sisodia Quits Sisodia Resigns As Delhi Deputy CM, Satyendar Jain Too Quits As Minister Bill Gates Bill Gates Visits RBI HQ In Mumbai; Meets Governor ShaktiKanta Das  Gurugram Men Riding Luxury Car Allegedly Steal Flower Pots From G20 Event in Gurugram snap Snap Joins AI Race; Announces To Integrate OpenAI's ChatGPT With Platform manish sisodia arrest Delhi Excise Policy Case: Manish Sisodia Resigns As Deputy Delhi CM India vs Australia 2023 LIVE Updates | IND VS AUS 3rd Test, Day 1 Cricket Match Live Score Ben stokes I’m Not Going To Lie...: Ben Stokes Opens Up On His Availability For CSK KL Rahul Rohit Sharma REVEALS Real Reason Behind Removing KL Rahul As Vice CaptainComments - Join the DiscussionTrending newsDNA VideoDNA: Famous writer Anant Pai passed away on this day in the year 2011DNA VideoDNA: For the first time in the year 1886, Aluminum was made in the laboratoryDNA VideoDNA: When India's first education minister Abul Kalam Azad died in 1958DNA VideoDNA: When will the Russia-Ukraine war end?DNA VideoDNA: Fear of corona infection, Home becomes 'Jail'

Here’s why Explained: Why Adani Enterprises rebounded sharply after falling 7% in early trade Shares of eight out of 10 Adani Group companies rebounded sharply during intraday trade, with flagship Adani Enterprises rising nearly 15 per cent after falling sharply in the morning. Here's all you need to know about the reb sound in Adani Group stocks. AdvertisementIndia Today Business DeskNew Delhi ,UPDATED: Feb 28, 2023 16:14 ISTAdani Enterprises zoomed over 24 per cent from day's low to trade in positive territory after several days. (Photo: Reuters) By India Today Business Desk: Shares of eight listed Adani Group companies rebounded sharply on Tuesday, offering a breather to billionaire Gaumtam Adani, whose empire has been constantly under pressure since last month after an explosive report was released by US short seller Hindenburg Research. Adani Enterprises saw the sharpest rebound out of 8 listed companies after falling over 7 per cent in early trade. The shares of the company zoomed nearly 24 per cent from the day’s low to register a sharp rebound. At around 1:30 pm, Adani Enterprises shares were up 12.64 per cent to trade at Rs 1,344.40 a piece. advertisementA rebound was also seen in other Adani Group listed companies such as Adani Green Energy, Adani Power, Adani Ports, Adani Wilmar, ACC, Ambuja Cements and NDTV. Only Adani Transmission and Adani Total Gas remained glued to their 5 per cent lower circuit. Also Read | 3 Adani Group stocks down nearly 80% in a month. Is Hindenburg’s prediction accurate?Decoding the sharp rebound Shares of eight listed Adani Group companies rose after a report by news agency Reuters indicated that the group is looking to prepay or repay share-backed loans worth between $690 million and $790 billion by the end of March 2023.The report added that the move is aimed at improving the group’s credit profile, which would also help it soothe investors who have been worried about high debt accumulated by the conglomerate’s listed firms. Adani Green Energy shares hit the 5 per cent upper circuit after the report, quoting sources, indicated that the company plans to refinance its 2024 bonds via a $800 million, three-year credit line. Also Read | Adani Group to repay $790 million share-backed loans by March: ReportThe plans were reportedly presented by the Adani management to the group’s bondholders in Hong Kong on Tuesday. It may be noted, however, that the Adani Group has not officially commented on the fresh debt repayment plans. Meanwhile, the group dismissed a February 27 report, which claimed that the group was looking to raise debt against shares of a key Australian asset.Another factor that led to the broad-based rally in Adani Group stocks is a report by Economic Times that banks have retained credit limits for the flagship Adani Enterprises. The report highlighted that domestic lenders, led by the State Bank of India, have decided to maintain the status quo on credit limits sanctioned for Adani Group’s flagship company. While eight stocks of the conglomerate rebounded strongly today, all of them have lost substantial market value after US short seller Hindenburg Research’s explosive report. The short seller accused the Adani Group of stock manipulation and improper use of tax havens, besides highlighting high debt levels. advertisementAdani Group dismissed the allegations and assured shareholders that it has strong cashflows and will face no issues with debts repayments. The group has already started prepaying/repaying its debt obligations in order to regain the confidence of investors. Also Read | Rs 12 lakh crore gone!

A photograph of Ashutosh Raghuvanshi, the station house officer (SHO) of Puranpur, is going viral on the social media in which he can be seen wearing a scarf with the ruling BJP`s lotus symbol and party colours over his uniform.

Thakur, who is currently the national president of a social group `Adhikar Sena`, said: ""Raghuvanshi`s act was an open violation of a police official`s `rule of conduct`. I had served the police for a long time and never came across any personnel displaying the symbol of a political party so publicly.

India NewsReported by Sunil PrabhuUpdated: February 28, 2023 5:35 pm ISTMost opposition parties have come out in support of AAPNew Delhi: The Congress is struggling with its response to the arrest of Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, who is Arvind Kejriwal's number two in the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).A day after talking about ""political vendetta, harassment and selective targeting of opposition leaders"", the Congress called for a ""proper investigation"" into the Delhi liquor case, in which Manish Sisodia was arrested on Sunday.""We want a proper investigation into the liquor scams,"" said the party's Supriya Srinate.The Congress also questioned AAP's silence when it came to showing support.""We want to ask AAP why they were silent, what their stand was when we were hounded by the agencies,"" Ms Srinate said.Most opposition parties have come out in support of AAP, which has strongly denied the allegations against its top leader.The Congress, however, has been slow to react and cautious when talking about a party that has been eating into its vote base in many states, even replacing it as main opposition party. Last year, the Congress lost Punjab, one of the few states it ruled, to an AAP sweep.The Congress and AAP have been adversaries from the start; one of the key factors behind the fall of the Manmohan Singh-led Congress government at the Centre in 2014 was the anti-corruption campaign of Anna Hazare, which also featured Arvind Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia. The Congress never quite recovered from that setback and has been losing ground ever since.Shortly after Mr Sisodia's arrest, the Congress in Delhi called it a ""welcome step"", playing its part of a bitter rival of AAP in the capital.As more and more opposition parties voiced their condemnation of the arrest, the Congress's leadership nuanced its response without referring to Manish Sisodia.""The Congress has always held the belief that institutions like ED (Enforcement Directorate), CBI and Income Tax Department have become instruments of political vendetta and harassment under Modi Sarkar. These institutions have lost all professionalism. Opposition leaders are selectively targeted to destroy their reputation,"" said Jairam Ramesh, Congress general secretary.Mr Sisodia's arrest has apparently unified the opposition ahead of next year's general election. Several parties have come out in support of AAP, including Congress allies like Shiv Sena, NCP, Nitish Kumar and Tejashwi Yadav.As the opposition preps to take on the BJP in 2024, the Congress's dilemma is bound to worsen.Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, who faces an election later this year, made a cautious comment on Mr Sisodia's arrest.PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com""Many Manish Sisodias have faced similar action and have been arrested. You and I don't know about them, but we know about Sisodia as he is deputy Chief Minister. Many journalists, writers and thinkers are in jail in this government. What's happening in the country, people have to think about it.

Now protect the EV with electric vehicle InsuranceS Jaishankar: India expects FTA with EU to be 'game-changer'Amit Shah, JP Nadda hold deliberations with Telangana BJP leadersPetrol prices remain high across India with the price being close to 100 rupees per litre in New Delhi, the nation’s capital. The petrol hike has made citizens miserable as they find it difficult to afford essential commodities and transportation in their day to day lives. These soaring gas prices remain high and keep rising despite India announcing that it is getting oil at a cheaper price from Russia. What is the current context of gasoline prices in India? How is the petrol price calculated in the first place? And will Indians see any respite at petrol pumps anytime soon?Why Are Petrol Prices Still So High in India? | When Will Fuel Prices Go Down? | Petrol Rise | TOIPrior to the pandemic, in 2020, an owner of a two-wheeler was paying approximately INR 900/- for a full tank of fuel. Today that cost is around INR 1500/-. To make things worse, petrol prices in India have been on the rise in recent months. According to the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, the average retail price of gasoline in India was Rs. 89 per litre in February 2023. This is a one rupee increase from the previous year, when the average retail price was Rs. 88 per litre.Why is the price increasing at all?! The factors driving this increase include a rise in international oil prices, fluctuations in the exchange rate between the Indian Rupee and the US Dollar, and changes in taxes and duties levied by the government. Refining costs also play a role in determining gasoline prices.That’s a lot of complicated terms at once. What do all of them mean and how is the price of petrol determined? The price of gasoline in India is determined primarily by 4 factors: International oil prices- this refers to the price of crude oil, which is the primary component of petrol. The price of crude oil is influenced by global supply and demand, geopolitical tensions like the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and changes in the market due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.The exchange rate between the Indian Rupee and the US Dollar also affects the price of gasoline in India as oil is priced in US dollars. At present, a weaker Rupee is increasing the cost of importing oil into India, leading to higher gasoline prices.Here’s an example. Suppose you go to the mall and spend INR 5000/- on shopping. Your total expense for the day is not just 5000 rupees. Keep in mind your uber also cost you INR 200/- to get to the mall and to come back home. In actuality, your total expenditure for the day was INR 5400/-. Refining costs also play a role in determining gasoline prices. The cost of refining crude oil into gasoline can be impacted by changes in the cost of raw materials, labor, and energy.Taxes levied by the Indian government also have a significant impact on the retail price of gasoline in India. Taxes and duties account for more than 50% of the retail price of gasoline in the country. This means if your petrol bill is 1000 rupees, over 500 rupees are because of taxes and duties. Why such high taxes in India?It’s easy to blame the government for not reducing the tax on petrol. In fact, those who are criticizing the current government seem to forget the fact that during the previous UPA government which was in power from 2004-2014, taxes on petroleum were high and the UPA government raised the tax not once, but several times to help meet its fiscal targets. The reality is, that no matter who is in power in India right now……the petrol prices would be high in India because the price of crude oil is also significantly high. And also, because the decision to reduce taxes on gasoline, including petrol, is a complex one that requires careful consideration of several factors. For starters, the Indian government collects taxes on gasoline to generate revenue that is used to fund various public services and infrastructure projects. The current Modi government has made infrastructure development a top priority and has invested hundreds of billions of dollars to finally get much needed modern infrastructure into India. One example is the Sagarmala project, which focuses on port-led development. This is estimated to cost over $120 billion USD.The Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana, which aims to connect all unconnected habitations in rural areas with all-weather roads, is another large infrastructure project that has been undertaken by the government and is estimated to cost several billion dollars.Another example is the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana, which aims to connect all unconnected habitations in rural areas with all-weather roads. According to estimates, the cost for this is several billion dollars. This is where the heavy tax we pay on petrol is going. Additionally, in recent years, the Indian government has faced rising fiscal deficits, which have put pressure on public finances. The COVID19 pandemic has also made it difficult to reduce taxes on gasoline, as the government may rely on this source of revenue to meet its financial obligations.Ultimately, the Indian government will have to weigh these considerations and make a decision that is in the best interests of the country and its citizens.Is there any relief in sight for Indians at petrol pumps?Despite getting cheap oil from Russia, high taxes, refining costs, exchange rate, distribution and transportation costs, and government subsidies contribute to high petrol prices in India.And it’s not just India that is facing high petrol prices. America’s price of gasoline is calculated in the same way as India. According to the US Energy Information Administration, the average retail price of gasoline in the United States was $3.02 per gallon on 10th February 2023.Like India, in Europe, taxes play a major role in determining gasoline prices. The European Union has a harmonized tax system for gasoline, meaning that the tax rate is similar across all member countries. However, each country also has its own national tax rate, which can impact the overall price of gasoline. In Germany, for example, the average retail price of gasoline was €1.64 per litre as of February 10, 2023. In China, the price of gasoline is set by the government and can change depending on changes in international oil prices. The price of gasoline in China is influenced by the same factors as India, including international oil prices, taxes, refining costs, and the exchange rate between the Chinese yuan and other currencies. According to the National Bureau of Statistics of China, the average retail price of gasoline in China was ¥7.00 per litre on February 10, 2023. At this point, even if the tax is taken out completely, gas prices will still be relatively high as compared to 2020 in India. Put simply, it is unrealistic to expect dramatically lower petrol prices in the near future. The silver lining though is that India has been exploring domestic oil production, with oilfields located in the states of Assam, Gujarat, and offshore in the Bay of Bengal. This could be a promising start to lessen our dependence on international oil which would make India less vulnerable to the volatile price fluctuations we are experiencing right now. What can be said for sure, is that as the Russia-Ukraine crisis becomes less hot-blooded, as the global economy stabilizes as does international crude prices AND the COVID-19 pandemic reaches an end, as the oil market will become less volatile as a result, disruptions will decrease as will the price of petrol.

Explore all about their expansion journey to India in this article.AdvertisementIndia Today Web DeskNew Delhi,UPDATED: Feb 28, 2023 11:28 ISTBy India Today Web Desk: Where do people turn to when they need health-related information?They google it.However, the performance and search engine optimisation (SEO) marketing strategies of most pharma and healthcare companies are far from effective and often non-existent. With this drastic industry gap in mind, Matt Lowe launched performance-io as the first-ever healthcare-centric SEO agency in 2018, which is now officially celebrating its expansion on Indian shores.advertisementHaving spent over a decade in pharma and working across a range of commercial sectors, Matt Lowe noticed that big pharma routinely ignores the very first step in nearly every one of its customers' user journeys: a search engine. Instead, they base their website content on their own brand priorities, key performance indicators (KPIs), and crucial success factors (CSFs) – things that their audience simply doesn’t care about.Born out of this observation and with a passion for digital marketing in healthcare, Lowe left pharma to set up healthcare's first specialist SEO agency, leading to the launch of what we now know as performance-io – winners of the PM Society Digital Agency of 2022.Early on in the agency’s rapid growth, Lowe tapped into the tech talent pool in the Indian market to ensure economies of scale and efficiencies that could be passed on to clients. After several years of successful partnerships, he formalized performance-io’s presence in India.On the 8th of February 2023, the performance-io PIOneers officially celebrated their brand launch across multiple locations in India, with their HQ in Kolkata, the ‘Cultural Capital of India’, and an extended team in Bangalore, the ‘Silicon Valley of India’.To mark the expansion of performance-io in India, Matt Lowe visited the team in India, together with Siobhan Robertson (Director, Global Head of SEO) and Michail Apokoroniotakis (SEO Account Director). The managing director of the India branch, Ronny Kar said, “Only a few SEO companies deliver a detailed breakdown of their clients’ online performance and provide a strategic plan to reach their targets. Also, the leadership team has a continued belief in people’s potential to grow, which is refreshing, as most multinational agencies treat India only as an offshore firm. This is very different from how we work at performance-io.”Seen as the ‘mavericks’ or zeitgeist in the healthcare digital marketing space, performance-io has become the go-to agency for SEO and SEO content in pharma and healthcare.  
Over the years, performance-io has worked with many global and well-known brands in the pharma and healthcare industry, some of them including:AstraZeneca
Galderma
Leo Pharma
Sanofi
Novo Nordisk
Elanco
AbbVie
Janssen
Novartis
HANX
Biogen
GSK
Aimmune
BMS
advertisementThe company also works with some major non-profit organisations, some of which include:PeaceLove
All About Obesity
VMA
As performance-io is launched in India, it now has a scope to be the go-to agency for Indian pharma businesses to increase their digital presence. As a European company, it is an excellent opportunity for performance-io to improve its PAN India presence, to which Matt Lowe said, “We’d like to continue to work with progressive partners/leaders across the marcoms mix to ensure their campaigns reach and help as many people as possible. This involves going on a journey together and not always doing what has been done before.”Disclaimer: The material and information contained are for advertorial purposes only.

Two bike-borne assailants had attacked Swamy with a machete and sped away. Narayana Swamy's son N Manikanta was an eyewitness to the killing and had filed a complaint with Marathahalli police the same day.Along with Manikanta, police arrested Adarsha T, 26, and Shiva Kumar NM, 26, from Hoskote.First wife murdered in 2013Manikanta told police he was upset as his father had decided to gift a flat to his (Manikanta's) wife Archana. A realtor, Narayana Swamy had constructed an apartment in Cauverappa Block and lived with his wife, Manikanta, and Archana in one of the flats. Archana is Manikanta's second wife and they have an infant daughter. His first wife was murdered in 2013 and police had arrested Manikanta on charges of killing her. However, he was acquitted in 2020 and married Archana, police said.Later, Manikanta and Archana developed differences and he allegedly stabbed and injured her in August last year. Booked for attempt to murder, Manikanta was imprisoned in Bengaluru Central Prison where he befriended Adarsha and Shiva Kumar. Manikanta came out on bail recently and Archana started living separately.Meanwhile, Narayana Swamy decided to register a flat in his apartment in the name of Archana so that she could lead an independent life. ""Swamy was of the opinion that Manikanta would not financially support Archana. He had also stopped giving money to Manikanta. These issues provoked Manikanta into deciding to eliminate his father as well as his mother for property, "" DCP (Whitefield) S Girish said. Manikanta has four elders sisters.Manikanta hatched the murder plot with Adarsha who assigned the work to Shiva Kumar. ""Manikanta promised Rs 1 crore in cash to Shiva Kumar after completing the task. He had also promised a flat and a car, each to Adarsha and Shiva Kumar,"" Girish said. Shiva Kumar was paid Rs 1 lakh advance.Start a ConversationFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIAFacebookTwitterInstagramKOO APPYOUTUBE Visual Stories  10 Bollywood celebs who no longer eat meatLifestyleHot makeup looks of Mrunal ThakurLifestyle11 times Malaika Arora proved she is the queen of fashionEntertainmentAlaya F wows the internet in a stylish bikiniindiaA look at Imlie fame Seerat Kapoor's Cheeni-inspired outfitstvInteresting experiences in Punjab for the traveller in youtravelG20 Summit: Special Haryanvi Menu for foreign delegatesFood10 alluring photos of Amritha AiyerEntertainmentHoli 2023: Ten Indian actresses in Rain songs and wet clothes…!Entertainment123ElectionsAssembly Elecetions 2023Elections 2023Nagaland Election ResultsMeghalaya Election ResultTripura Election ResultKarnataka Elections 2023Exit Polls 2023Tripura Exit PollsTop TrendingExit Polls 2023KL RahulPM Kisan SchemeManish SisodiaMumbai Train AccidentBihar Budget 2023 LiveTrending StoriesIn CityEntire WebsiteCauvery drying up, water crisis looms in KushalnagarPutani Express will once again ring in cheer @ Cubbon ParkIndiGo Hubballi-Pune daily flight to start on March 13Nigerian promises nurse job in UK, scams Karnataka woman of Rs 34 lakhDad hacked to death after son gives Rs 1-cr supariJoin this IISc course on Intelligent AutomationMIT xPRO’s COO ProgrammeProtect your EV with electric vehicle insuranceNo toll collection on Mysuru e-way till March 14Veterinary students in K'taka want stipend hikedAs Russia faces curbs, Air India to get this year six wide-body A350s meant for Aeroflot30K in MP uploaded child abuse material; over 4k likely to be arrestedWho murdered Shashikant?

She and her family members are accused in killing of the witness. Umesh Pal and his police security guard Sandeep Nishad were shot dead last Friday outside his home in the Dhoomanganj area of Prayagraj. Another constable was injured in this attack. Atiq Ahmed is the prime accused in the BSP MLA Raju Pal's murder case and is currently lodged in a Gujarat jail.

In the letter addressed to the chief minister, Shaista Parveen said, ""Friday's incident is extremely sad and condemnable. An FIR has been lodged by Umesh Pal's wife naming nine people including my husband Atiq Ahmed, my brother-in-law Khalid Azim alias Ashraf, me and my sons and nine unknown people.""

""In this FIR, my husband, brother-in-law and sons have been accused of conspiracy, and based on CCTV footage, my son Ali has been named as the shooter. This allegation is completely baseless,"" she said in the letter.

""The truth is that ever since the BSP declared me as the mayoral candidate from Prayagraj, a local leader and a cabinet minister in your government have conspired against us to retain the post of mayor. As part of this conspiracy, a person was killed, the allegation for which was natural to fall on my husband.""

She further claimed, ""Umesh Pal was not a witness in the Raju Pal murder case, but he was a litigant in the kidnapping case registered at Dhoomanganj police station, in which his testimony has already been recorded in the court on August 16 and 17, 2016.""

""Since the Prayagraj police is working under the pressure of your minister, under a conspiracy on the pretext of remand, my husband and brother-in-law can be called from jail and killed on the way,"" Praveen feared.
Parveen has demanded in the letter that the case lodged regarding the murder of Umesh Pal should be investigated by CBI. A copy of the letter has also been shared on various social media platforms.

Meanwhile, the Uttar Pradesh police on Monday said it has gunned down an accused in the February 24 killing of the prime witness Umesh Pal.

(Photo courtesy: Getty Images)In ShortThere has been an alarming rise in cases of shigella bacteria spread in the US.Shigella bacteria is a drug-resistant stomach bug.Officials have called it a ""serious public health threat"" in the US. By Daphne Clarance: The national public health organisation of the United States, on Friday, issued a warning about the alarming rise of shigella bacteria cases in the country. The Center for Disease and Control Prevention (CDC), in a statement, said that the rise in a strain of the drug-resistant bug is affecting thousands of Americans each other, according to BBC. advertisementThe shigella bacteria causes fever, diarrhoea and stomach pain. The rise of cases linked to the drug-resistant stomach bug has been noted since 2015, the health officials said. Since the infection cannot be easily treated with medication, it has led officials to call it a ""serious public health threat"". As per the report, while none of the infections recorded in 2015 were tied to the shigella XDR strain, 5 per cent were linked to it in 2022. In 2019, 1 per cent of the total cases of infection in the US were linked to the strain, which is resistant to five antibiotics that are most commonly used to treat it.

Found in the intestinal tract of infected people, shigella is spread by eating or drinking food or water contaminated with the bacteria. It can also spread via sexual contact and the faecal-oral route as well, the health body said.The surprising fact is that it takes a small amount of shigella to cause illness. The symptoms, which usually last 5-7 days, include fever, stomach pain, feeling the need to pass stool even when your bowels are empty and diarrhoea.

An invitation was sent to him by his Indian counterpart, S Jaishankar. INDIA CHINA BORDER TENSIONSIndia and China have been locked in a lingering border standoff in eastern Ladakh for over 31 months. The bilateral relationship came under severe strain following the deadly clash in Galwan Valley in Eastern Ladakh in June, 2020.
India has been maintaining that the relationship cannot be normal unless there is peace in the border area. According to the Ministry of External Affairs, discussions between both countries are underway through diplomatic and military channels. Both sides are focusing on getting back to a degree of normalcy and de-escalation and disengagement at the border, the ministry said. Tensions between India and China escalated after troops from the two sides were engaged in a clash along the LAC at Yangtse in the Tawang sector of Arunachal Pradesh on December 9. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said in Parliament on December 13 that the Chinese troops tried to ""unilaterally"" change the status quo in the Yangtse area but the Indian Army compelled them to retreat by its firm and resolute response.On February 22, both countries discussed proposals for disengaging in the two remaining friction areas along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) to create conditions to “restore normalcy” in relations. This was the first visit by a top Indian official to China in more than three years.Qin’s visit to India will be the first by the Chinese Foreign Minister after his predecessor Wang Yi’s visit to New Delhi in 2019 to attend the Special Representatives dialogue on the border mechanism.ALSO READ | G20 meet in India ends without consensus on Ukraine war, Russia accuses West of destabilising talksJAPAN FOREIGN MINISTER LIKELY TO SKIP G-20 MEETJapanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi is likely to skip a meeting with G-20 counterparts in India this week due to a scheduling conflict with a Diet session, a ruling party source told Japan Today.

India NewsAsian News InternationalUpdated: February 28, 2023 5:38 pm ISTThe Court earlier had granted them interim bail in the case.  (Representational)New Delhi: The Rouse Avenue Court today granted regular bail to five accused including two former Excise Department officials in the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) case of the Delhi Government Excise policy case.The Court earlier had granted them interim bail in the case. All the five accused were not arrested by the investigating agency during the probe.The Special Judge MK Nagpal today granted regular bail to Sameer Mahendru, Kuldeep Singh, Narender Singh, Arun Ramchandra Pillai, and Mootha Goutam in the Delhi Liquor Excise Policy Case, being investigated by CBI.Earlier, the Court had granted interim bail to two former Excise Department officials Kuldeep Singh and Narender Singh. The Court had also granted bail to Gautam Mootha and Arun Pillai and Businessman Sameer Mahendru.Businessman Sameer Mahendru to remain in Judicial Custody in Excise Policy case being investigated by Enforcement Directorate.Two other accused Vijay Nair and Abhishek Boinpally were already granted bail earlier by the same court.However, Vijay Nair and Abhishek Boinpally were remained in Judicial custody as they were also arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) Excise Money Laundering case and their Bail petition is pending before the trial court.In the same case, CBI has also arrested Delhi's Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia on Sunday and the court sent him on remand till March 4, 2023. CBI counsel told the court that the Delhi Deputy CM's custodial interrogation was required for an effective investigation into the case.The CBI has recently filed chargesheet against 7 accused persons and out of these 7 only the accused Vijay Nair and Abhishek Bonipally are found to have been arrested. Bail granted to both of them is under challenge before High Court. Chargesheet qua five other accused is filed without arrest, noted the court.Recently, CBI challenged the trial court order granting bail to Vijay Nair and Abhishek Boinpally in Delhi High Court.CBI's Petition stated that the trial court Judge has not only granted the concession of bail to the respondent accused in an extremely serious and wide-ranging economic offence but this discretion has been exercised at a very crucial stage of the investigation.Investigation Agency submits that of the seven tests prescribed by the Supreme Court to test any discretionary order dealing with bail has not been complied with in the present case. It is also submitted that the present case is a case of a conspiracy sought to be carried out in an extremely convoluted manner with a clear purpose of making an attempt that the investigation if any, does not reach the real culprits.According to the CBI, it commenced an investigation and unearthed the conspiracy led by the present applicant who was collecting money from private liquor wholesalers in lieu of getting favourable changes made in the Excise Policy of 2021.The Rouse Avenue Court on February 16, 2023, had rejected the bail petitions of five accused who were arrested in the money laundering probe emerging out of the Delhi government's now scrapped excise policy.While rejecting the bail plea, the court noted that none of the accused deserves to be released on bail in this case at this stage of proceedings as the allegations made against them are quite serious.The Special Judge MK Nagpal while rejecting the bail plea of Vijay Nair, Abhishek Bonipally, Sameer Mahendru, Sarath P Reddy and Binoy Babu observed that the accused persons do not even satisfy the triple test as laid down in the case of P Chidambaram vs Directorate of Enforcement being relied upon by Defence Counsels.PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.comThe FIR in the case was instituted on a reference from the Union Home Ministry following a recommendation from Delhi Lieutenant-Governor Vinai Kumar Saxena.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)Featured Video Of The Day""You Have Shamed Anna Hazare"": BJP To AAP On Manish Sisodia's ArrestAlso ReadOn Support For Manish Sisodia And AAP, Congress's Struggle Is RealLive Updates: ""Not Ready To Entertain"" - No Supreme Court Relief For Manish Sisodia""Why No Case Against Ex Lt Governor"": AAP Leader On Manish Sisodia ArrestTrack Latest News Live on NDTV.com and get news updates from India  and around the world.

The other 26,000 cases are under scrutiny. Potential arrest lists are being dispatched from the state cyber cell headquarters to 10 districts, sources in the home department told TOI.The number of arrests will then cross the 3,500 in Vyapam, India's biggest recruitment scam. As per NCMEC data, Indore tops the list of maximum CSAM uploads, with more than 2,000 cases, followed by over 1,000 in Bhopal, sources in the home ministry said. Around 500 to 600 cases have been reported from other cities, including Gwalior, Jabalpur, Dhar and Khargone. The state cyber HQ has shared the data - IP addresses, locations and devices used - with SPs for further action.""Arresting 4,000 people is going to be a herculean task, but we will take action,"" said a police officer, adding that investigations so far suggest that none of the girls in any of the illegal content were from MP. ""The videos are of girls from other countries. They were downloaded, uploaded or shared on social media platforms,"" he said. Officers also said that in some cases, the content cannot be termed as CSAM. ""One of the videos, for instance, appears to be from a village and shows an old woman feeding an infant, who is unclothed. This content may have been flagged by an AI-based detection system. We don't find it actionable as of today,"" said the officer. Social media platforms use trackers for data on child porn videos, he said. ""Such software has an algorithm that scans for nudity and expression of stress on the face of a child, following which an alert is generated and the content is passed on to law enforcement agencies. When photos or videos are found not linked to child pornography, cases are dropped,"" he explained. Police in chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan's government - which has a zero tolerance for crimes against women and children and has a law for death penalty to child rapists - have been using this data to track CSAM offenders. Around 50 people have been arrested in the last few years.In 2017, the MP government had approved a bill for death sentence for the rape of girls aged 12 and below. MP courts awarded the capital punishment to 72 offenders since then, judgements being delivered within a week in some cases. NCMEC, America's centralised reporting system for online exploitation of children, had been sharing these 'CyberTipline reports' with India following an agreement it signed with the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) on February 29, 2019.What is CyberTiplineCyberTipline was created so that children and their parents can swiftly report suspected incidents of child sexual exploitation that occur on the Internet, including activities involving the possession, manufacture, and distribution of child pornography, online enticement of children for sexual purposes, child prostitution, child sex tourism, child sexual molestation, and unsolicited obscene material sent to a child. Alerts are posted by citizens on a dedicated website or number or through AI, which are converted into actionable reports.

A set of rules have been also laid down for breeders, residents welfare associations and individuals who adopt stray dogs in large numbers. Registration of stray dogs will be done without any fees.

Lucknow is going to be the first city in the state to implement the new rules.

Officials of the Lucknow Municipal Corporation said that the newly formulated standard operating procedure by the government is going to be implemented while allowing the registration of dogs in the coming days.

The policy will not apply to Noida as it is an industrial area, governed by the industries development department, and has its own set of rules for dog owners.
While registration of stray dogs will be done without any fees along with sterilization and first vaccination, individuals and resident groups looking to adopt five or more stray dogs will be treated at par with shelter homes and will have to adhere to the guidelines framed by the Animal Welfare Board of India.

The idea is to make dog owners accountable for the actions of their pets, stray dog lovers will also have to be equally cautious if they aspire to become a true master of their colony dogs.

The civic body that registers the pet will also have to provide a chip or a token to the dog owner, which will bear the registration number of the pet along with details such as the owner`s name, address, and contact number.

The chip will have to be fixed with the collar when the dog is taken out for a walk or other routine.
""If the dog is found without the chip while it is on road or out of the house in a public place, the municipal staff has been authorised to seize and take away such dogs to the government-run shelter homes. The local bodies will decide the penalty and will hand the dog back to their owner upon payment,"" said a senior officer from the urban development department.

Circulated among the municipal commissioners and executive heads of the urban local bodies on Monday, the fresh SoPs finalized by the principal secretary of the urban development department, Amrit Abhijat, mentioned the set of rules that will have to be followed by breeders and sellers, shelter operators, individuals along with the format of the undertaking that is going to be taken from various stakeholders at the time of their registration.Live TvDog ownersPet dogsdogsDog attackMore Stories Manish Sisodia Quits Sisodia Resigns As Delhi Deputy CM, Satyendar Jain Too Quits As Minister Bill Gates Bill Gates Visits RBI HQ In Mumbai; Meets Governor ShaktiKanta Das  Gurugram Men Riding Luxury Car Allegedly Steal Flower Pots From G20 Event in Gurugram snap Snap Joins AI Race; Announces To Integrate OpenAI's ChatGPT With Platform manish sisodia arrest Delhi Excise Policy Case: Manish Sisodia Resigns As Deputy Delhi CM India vs Australia 2023 LIVE Updates | IND VS AUS 3rd Test, Day 1 Cricket Match Live Score Ben stokes I’m Not Going To Lie...: Ben Stokes Opens Up On His Availability For CSK KL Rahul Rohit Sharma REVEALS Real Reason Behind Removing KL Rahul As Vice CaptainComments - Join the DiscussionTrending newsDNA VideoDNA: Famous writer Anant Pai passed away on this day in the year 2011DNA VideoDNA: For the first time in the year 1886, Aluminum was made in the laboratoryDNA VideoDNA: When India's first education minister Abul Kalam Azad died in 1958DNA VideoDNA: When will the Russia-Ukraine war end?DNA VideoDNA: Fear of corona infection, Home becomes 'Jail'

The leaders are expected to discuss issues related to the KCR government and the party's strategy to fight elections at the grassroots level in southern states. The leaders will also discuss how the BJP will highlight the alleged link in the Delhi liquor policy case with people connected to K Kavitha, leader of the Bharat Rashtra Samithi and KCR's daughter. The CBI has already questioned Kavitha and arrested Butchibabu Gorantla, a former chartered accountant of the BRS leader in excise policy case. Prior to the core committee meeting, Amit Shah, JP Nadda and Tarun Chugh held a separate meeting for about 40 minutes.

Bansal will inform the committee about the public response to these street meetings.Since the deadline for holding Nukkad Sabhas is coming to an end today, the outline for the further organisational program can be decided in today's meeting.Telangana BJP leaders including Vijay Santhi, Vivek Venkatswamy, NEC member Etala Rajendran, G Mohan Rao and Muralidhar Rao are also in attendance.

Our doors are open, but we are not ready to hear it at this stage.""""This will be a very bad precedent. You can't do this just because you're in Delhi,"" Justice PS Narasimha said, referring to Mr Sisodia's request to rule his arrest by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) ""illegal"".Earlier today when the matter came up for hearing in the Supreme Court, Mr Singhvi cited the court's judgment in the Vinod Dua case as the reason why Mr Sisodia should be given relief, after which the court posted the matter to 3.45 pm.The Supreme Court in June 2021 cancelled a sedition case against journalist Vinod Dua over his criticism of the centre's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. Mr Dua had come to the Supreme Court directly.Later this evening, when the Supreme Court took up Mr Sisodia's request again, it said the Vinod Dua case has no relevance whatsoever with his case as the journalist's matter was about freedom of speech and expression while his case is about alleged corruption.After the hearing, Mr Sisodia's lawyer said they have withdrawn their request to the Supreme Court and will go to the trial court. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in a statement, however, said they will challenge Mr Sisodia's arrest in the Delhi High Court.A Delhi court yesterday gave the CBI Mr Sisodia's custody for five days. The central agency told the city court it needs time to question him over alleged corruption in making the new liquor policy, which was scrapped after Lieutenant Governor VK Saxena flagged it.The CBI told the Delhi court that Mr Sisodia has been giving evasive replies to their questions and is unable to explain at least six problematic provisions in the liquor policy that were not part of the first draft.The CBI said the changes were made at the behest of a liquor lobby in exchange for kickbacks to the tune of Rs 30 crore.Delhi's ruling AAP, led by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, and opposition parties in the centre including the Trinamool Congress and the Samajwadi Party have condemned the CBI over Mr Sisodia's arrest. The AAP said Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his party, the BJP, are scared of Mr Kejriwal and Mr Sisodia's ""rise"" and are trying hard to sabotage their plans for the national election next year.PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.comThe Trinamool Congress, taking a swipe at PM Modi, said the BJP is left with only a few allies, namely ""ED, CBI, I-T"", referring to the Enforcement Directorate and the income tax department, apart from the agency that arrested Mr Sisodia.The BJP denied the centre has been using the CBI to harass the AAP leaders. The BJP said Mr Sisodia, who is also Delhi's Education Minister and claims to have made excellent policies to improve schools, cannot hide alleged corruption behind the safety of work done on the education front.Also ReadRead Manish Sisodia's Resignation Letter To Arvind KejriwalManish Sisodia, Satyendar Jain Should've Quit Delhi Cabinet Earlier: BJP""Stepping Away Till...,"" Writes Manish Sisodia In Resignation LetterTrack Latest News Live on NDTV.com and get news updates from India  and around the world.

But it was also meant to acknowledge BS Yediyurappa’s stature in Karnataka’s politics. And this is crucial ahead of the assembly election in the southern state.
AdvertisementIndia Today News DeskNew Delhi,UPDATED: Feb 28, 2023 13:06 ISTPM Modi with former Karnataka CM BS Yediyurappa walks hand-in-hand during the inauguration of the Shivamogga Airport. (PTI photo)By India Today News Desk: On Monday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi felicitated BS Yediyurappa during the inauguration ceremony of the Shivamogga airport. Then, PM Modi held the former Karnataka chief minister’s hand and both leaders walked hand-in-hand as photographers scrambled to capture the moment. The images went viral.The prime minister’s gesture stemmed through the camaraderie and respect that the two share. But it was also meant to acknowledge BS Yediyurappa’s stature in Karnataka’s politics. And this is crucial ahead of the assembly election in the southern state.advertisementLet’s go back a little.In July 2021, Basavaraj Bommai replaced BS Yediyurappa as Karnataka’s chief minister. Such replacements happen when the incumbent is seen as not good for the party’s prospects, no matter the past. Such replacements happen mostly when allegations, often of corruption or highhandedness within the party or the government, become too shrill to defend.ALSO READ | On Yediyurappa's birthday, PM Modi takes on Congress in poll-bound Karnataka And Yediyurappa has been no ordinary politician. He is a four-time chief minister. He is popular among large sections of Lingayat voters, crucial for an election victory in the state. He knows the party and the government machinery inside out. Naturally, irrespective of public posturing on both sides, he was and is hurt. After all, Bommai was a mere minister in Yediyurappa’s government.Since the change of guard, there have been “reports” of either Yediyurappa “skipping” BJP or Karnataka government events or his being “sidelined” by those who did his bidding not long ago. All this while, Yediyurappa has said that all is well but also with a resounding warning – “nobody can finish me off”. “I have my own strength. I have strengthened the party and toiled to bring BJP to power. The entire state knows this,” he has said.And the BJP leadership, which decided to replace Yediyurappa, doesn’t want him “finished off” either. In fact, it’s a case of competing desires for the top brass. A year after the change in guard, Yediyurappa was made part of the BJP’s parliamentary board.By putting Yediyurappa on the parliamentary board, the BJP looked like sending out a message that it had not abandoned its old war horse. It was a message for Bommai, many would argue, that he cannot take his job for granted as his predecessor will have a role to play in how Karnataka’s politics plays out in the coming days.ALSO READ | Dream come true, says Yediyurappa as PM Modi inaugurates Shivamogga airport on his birthdayTHE DELHI MEETINGadvertisementAnd all this messaging got further deepened and strengthened when Prime Minister Narendra Modi granted a 15-minute one-on-one audience to Yediyurappa on the sidelines of the ongoing two-day national executive meeting of the BJP in New Delhi in January. The 15-minute conversation follows Yediyurappa’s absence from a PM Modi show in Karnataka about a week ago. The explanation then was, it was a government event and Yediyurappa is only part of the party.ALSO WATCH | PM Modi meets BS Yediyurappa, prompts leadership talk in Karnataka KARNATAKA CONNECTIONKarnataka is one of the nine states where assembly elections will be held this year. And one of the key agendas of the national executive meeting is to thrash out winning formulas. The 15-minute meeting is a reassertion that the Lingayat strongman is part of the pack.The Lingayats comprise about 17 per cent of Karnataka’s population and are the single-largest community in the state, mostly in the northern region. They have been traditional BJP voters but have recently been on the warpath, seeking a greater share of reservation. Cold-shouldering Yediyurappa could backfire further.More than anything else, Karnataka is the only southern state where the BJP has broken through and, along with Pondicherry, remains a crucial window to the party’s plan to expand in the rest of the virgin region.advertisementALSO READ | BJP never sidelined me, grateful to PM Modi for opportunities, says YediyurappaThis is especially given the BJP’s awareness of the need to work much harder in some states above the Vindhyas ahead of 2024 when PM Modi seeks a third straight term.HAND-IN-HANDThen the hand-in-hand gesture on Monday. It was a clear message to the party cadre. Monday was BSY’s birthday. And the PM requested the audience to raise the flashlights of their smartphones as a show of respect for him. This evoked a huge response. And nothing was left to imagination when BJP IT cell chief Amit Malviya tweeted, “The Prime Minister and BSY go back a long way. The camaraderie and mutual respect is unmissable. This gesture of PM holding BSY’s hand as he walks in to inaugurate the airport is an acknowledgment of BSY’s seminal role in opening the gates of South India for the BJP.”ALSO READ | Despite his hard bargain, Yediyurappa is BJP’s poll totem in Karnataka Yediyurappa’s resurrection may not be a precursor to another change of guard in Karnataka—there’s hardly any time left before the state goes to the polls—but the messaging is clear. It’s likely that Yediyurappa will play a greater role for the party in the coming election.advertisementThis has come at a time when CM Bommai is facing a barrage of corruption allegations against him from the Congress. As it is, issues such as the Lingayat quota row and the Karnataka-Maharashtra border controversy have become a headache for the Karnataka government.And all this doesn’t look good for BJP's chief election strategist Amit Shah’s ""Mission 136"" — the party must win 136 of the state's 224 assembly seats. It will be interesting to see whether the greater spotlight on the man who brought the BJP to power for the first time in Karnataka (in 2008) helps or hinders this goal.ALSO READ | 'Disposable tissue papers': Congress claims PM ignored Bommai in Shivamogga address--- ENDS ---

After committing the murder, the accused set ablaze the dismembered body parts to destroy evidence. On Monday, police moved a petition before a local court seeking his custody for eight days. In the remand report of the accused, P Hari Hara Krishna, a final-year B Tech student of an engineering college in Peerzadiguda, police alleged that about two months ago he purchased a steel knife and gloves to murder N Naveen, 22, B Tech final-year student of Mahatma Gandhi University in Narketpally.""Krishna was in love with Naveen's ex-girlfriend. Naveen continued to call her even after they broke up, Krishna felt threatened and decided to eliminate him three months ago,"" said a Rachakonda police official. As per the plan, two months ago, Krishna purchased a steel knife from D Mart at Malakpet and two pairs of gloves from a medical shop nearby, police mentioned in the remand report. On February 17, a few hours before committing the gruesome act, Krishna had lunch with Naveen at LB Nagar and then took him home. Both of them met a friend of Krishna's. Krishna borrowed 18,000 through a loan app and they helped her purchase a cell phone for 30,000. At around 9.30pm, when the victim wanted to return to his college hostel in Narketpally, the accused picked up the backpack containing the knife and the gloves. They consumed liquor at a shop in Pedda Amberpet and then rode a bike to an isolated area near Rama Devi Public School in Abdullapurmet. ""The accused throttled the victim and then beheaded him using the knife. He ripped out his heart after opening his stomach and then chopped off the private parts along with fingers. He stuffed the severed body parts in a backpack and threw them at different places near Brahmanpally in the city outskirts. Subsequently, he went to a friend, Hasan's house in Brahmanpally and cleaned himself. Later in the morning, he told his girlfriend and Hasan about the murder. They advised him to surrender before the cops,"" police said.However, instead of immediately surrendering before the cops, Krishna travelled to Kodad, Vijayawada and Visakhapatnam to evade possible police investigation. On February 23, Krishna met his father at Warangal. On the same day, he picked up Naveen's thrown body parts and set them ablaze at Abdullapurmet. Realising that arrest was imminent, he surrendered before the cops on February 24 afternoon, police said.

            ​				                HomeIndia NewsSupreme Court's Strong Message To Punjab Government, Governor Amid Face-Off Supreme Court's Strong Message To Punjab Government, Governor Amid Face-Off  The Punjab government had gone to court after the Governor delayed convening the  state assembly for the budget session. India NewsReported by Sunil Prabhu, Edited by Anindita SanyalUpdated: February 28, 2023 5:25 pm ISTNew Delhi: The latest stand-off between the Aam Aadmi Party government in Punjab and Governor Banwarilal Purohit indicates a need of constitutional discourse, the Supreme Court said today, sending a strong message to both sides. ""The failure of a constitutional authority to fulfill its duty would not be a justification for another to not fulfill his distinct duty under constitution,"" said Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud, who headed the bench hearing the case.""We may belong to different political parties. The office of the Governor is not from a party, but we have to have a constitutional discourse,"" the Chief Justice added.The case had stemmed from a face-off between the Governor and the Chief Minister over some information sought by Mr Purohit, who then delayed convening the state assembly for the budget session.  In a letter to Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann, the Governor had also indicated that he is in no hurry to summon the session and reminded the Chief Minister about his ""derogatory"" response to a letter from Raj Bhavan.The court said the Chief Minister is constitutionally bound to furnish the Governor with information and ""not furnishing the information would be against his constitutional duty"". Moreover, ""The tone of the Chief Minister left much to be desired... Yet on the other hand, the dereliction of the Chief Minister to do so would not allow the Governor to not do his constitutional duty to summon the budget session,"" Justice Chandrachud said.The Governor does not enjoy discretionary powers under the Constitution's Article 174 in summoning the assembly -- a point that has been settled in the Nabam Rebia case by a Constitution bench of the top court.Also, the Governor, while responding, refers to the cabinet's decision and the tweet and the letter dated February 14 and spoke of seeking legal advice. These were ""patently unconstitutional... There is no question of seeking legal advice on convening the house. He was duty bound,"" the court said.""Political differences in a democratic polity are acceptable and have to be worked out with sobriety. Unless these principles were borne in mind, the effective implementation of constitutional values is liable to be placed in jeopardy,"" the Chief Justice said.As the state government went to court, the Governor had convened the assembly, pointed out Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who was representing the Raj Bhavan. He pointed out that under the circumstances, the state's petition does not apply, since events have overtaken it.The Chief Justice, however, indicated that there were several takeaways from the matter.PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com""While on the one hand, the administration of state is entrusted to a democratically elected Chief Minister, which in turn forces collective responsibility, the Governor as a constitutional authority appointed by government, is entrusted with duty to guide and counsel,"" said the Chief Justice of India.Track Latest News Live on NDTV.com and get news updates from India  and around the world.

(AP Photo)New Zealand's sensational 1 run win vs England on Day 5 of the Wellington Test has not just made fans across the world sit up and say wow, it has also equaled the record for the smallest margin of victory in a Men's Test match, in terms of runs.Incredibly, the Kiwis won the match despite being asked to follow-on. In fact this was just the fourth time in the history of Men's Test cricket that a team won a match after following on.England who were chasing 258 to win needed 57 to win at one stage with as many as 5 of their wickets intact. However the Kiwi bowlers led by left arm pacer Neil Wagner spoiled their party and helped the hosts win the match to tie the 2 Test series at 1-1.Wagner took 4/62 in England's second innings.This is one match that will never be forgotten by cricket fans, much like the 2001 Eden Gardens Test between India and Australia, which India won by 171 runs after being asked to follow on. That in fact was the last time a team had won a Test match after following on, before the Kiwis beat England on Tuesday.TimesofIndia.com here takes a look at the 3 smallest margins of victory in Men's Test cricket and how those historic and unforgettable games unfolded:1993 - West Indies beat Australia by 1 run in AdelaideBatting first the Windies were bowled out for 252. Brian Lara was the only batter who managed to cross 50 (52). The pick of the Aussie bowlers was Merv Hughes who took 5/64. Australia in response couldn't put up a strong batting performance. The hosts managed to make only 213, which gave the West Indies a 39 run first innings lead. Interestingly Merv Hughes was the top scorer for the Aussies, scoring 43 off 66v balls. This was a match dominated by the bowlers. When West Indies came out to bat in their second innings, they were treated to some hostile bowling by both the Aussie pacers and spinners. Craig McDermott took 3 wickets, Hughes took 1, while off-spinner Tim May took a sensational 5 wickets for just 9 runs. The Windies were bowled out for 146, which left Australia a target of just 186 to chase. But the Aussies were in for a rude shock. Curtly Ambrose (4/46), Courtney Walsh (3/44) and Ian Bishop (2/41) broke the back of the Aussie batting order, as their second innings was wrapped up for 184, handing the West Indies a 1 run win. This margin of victory stood as the sole record for the smallest margin of victory in a Men's Test match till February 28, 2023 - for over 30 years.2023 - New Zealand beat England by 1 run in WellingtonEngland had won the first Test of this 2 Test series and were looking good to stun the Kiwis in their own backyard with a 2-0 series win. However, it was the Kiwis who had the last laugh in the second Test in Wellington, despite being under the pump for large parts of the match.England batted first in this match and put on a mammoth 435/8 (dec). Young Harry Brook was the standout batter for the English, with a sensational 186 run knock. At the other end former captain Joe Root made 153 not out. Brooks and Root shared a 302 run fourth wicket stand. For the Kiwis, Matt Henry was the pick of the bowlers with figures of 4/100.New Zealand in response had a torrid time in their first innings. Incredibly, captain Tim Southee, a fast bowler, was their top scorer with a 49 ball 73 run knock. Only 4 of the 10 Kiwi batters could reach double digits, as the hosts folded for 209, handing England a big 226 run first innings lead. Stuart Broad took 4/61, while James Anderson took 3/37 and Jack Leach took 3/80 with his left arm spin. The Kiwis were asked to follow on and in their second innings they put up a much better display with the bat, scoring 483. Former captain Kane Williamson top scored with 132. Tom Blundell made 90, Tom Latham scored 83, Devon Conway made 61 and Daryl Mitchell made 54. That meant England were given a target of 258 to win the Test.When England came out to bat, the Kiwis managed to strike at regular intervals. The visitors went from 39/0 to 80/5. However the target wasn't a very steep one. They had finished day 4 at 48/1 and with a full day's play left, they were still the favourites. At one stage they needed just 57 runs more with 5 wickets still in hand. But Neil Wagner, Tim Southee and Matt Henry turned the tide completely. England went from 201/5 to 256 all out, falling short of their target by 2 runs and handing New Zealand a 1 run win. This margin of victory equaled the smallest margin of victory in a Men's Test match.2005 - England beat Australia by 2 runs in BirminghamOn this occasion England were on the winning side. This was the second Test match on Australia's tour of England and Scotland.England batted first and made 407. Opener Marcus Trescothick made a quickfire 90 off 102 balls. Kevin Pietersen made 71, Andrew Flintoff made 68. Shane Warne was the pick of the Aussie bowlers with 4 wickets for 116 runs. Michael Kasprowicz took 3/80, while Jason Gillespie took 2/91. Australia responded with 308 in their first innings. Opener Justin Langer was the top scorer of this innings with 82, captain Ricky Ponting made 61, Adam Gilchrist was unbeaten on a 69 ball 49. This handed England a 99 run first innings lead. Andrew Flintoff and Ashley Giles both took 3 wickets, while Simon Jones took 2/69.The Aussies needed to hit back hard with the ball and they did. England in their second innings could muster just 182. Andrew Flintoff was the top scorer with 73, while the next best score belonged to Trescothick and Ian Bell who both scored 21. Shane Warne was the pick of the bowlers with figures of 6/46. Brett Lee took the other 4 English wickets. This meant that Australia needed 282 runs to win the Test match.The momentum begun to shift yet again in the Australian second innings. The visitors went from 47/0 to 137/7. They were eventually bowled out for 279. Brett Lee and Shane Warne the two top scorers for the Aussies with the bat, making 43 and 42 runs respectively. Flintoff was the best English bowler, taking 4/79. He was able supported by Steve Harmison (2/62), Ashley Giles (2/68), Matthew Hoggard (1/26) and Simon Jones (1/23).

Now protect the EV with electric vehicle InsuranceNational Science Day 2023: History, purpose and role of CV RamanJ&K: Terrorist who shot dead Kashmiri Pandit in Pulwama eliminated in encounterBENGALURU: The Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro), on Monday said that the flight acceptance hot test of the CE-20 cryogenic engine that will power the cryogenic upper stage (CUS) of the GSLV-Mk3 or LVM3 launch vehicle for the Chandrayaan-3 mission was successfully conducted on February 24 at its propulsion complex, Mahendragiri. “The hot test was carried out for a planned duration of 25 seconds at the high altitude test facility. All the propulsion parameters during the test were found satisfactory and closely matched with predictions. The cryogenic engine will be further integrated with the propellant tanks, stage structures and associated fluid lines to realise the fully integrated flight cryogenic stage,” Isro said.The Chandrayaan-3 mission, which Isro is targeting this year, has been gaining pace in the past few weeks. Key Lander Test TooBetween January 31 and February 3, the Chandrayaan-3 lander successfully underwent EMI/EMC (Electro - Magnetic Interference/ Electro-Magnetic Compatibility) test.According to Isro, the test is conducted for satellite missions to ensure the functionality of the satellite subsystems in the space environment and their compatibility with the expected electromagnetic levels. This test is a major milestone in the realisation of the satellites.Reiterating that the Chandrayaan-3 mission has three major modules — the Propulsion module, Lander module, and Rover — Isro said, the mission’s complexity calls for establishing radio-frequency (RF) communication links between the modules.“During the Chandrayaan-3 lander EMI/EC test, launcher compatibility, antenna polarisation of all RF systems, standalone auto compatibility tests for orbital and powered descent mission phases, and lander & rover compatibility tests for post landing mission phase were ensured. The performance of the systems was satisfactory,” Isro said.Start a ConversationFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIAFacebookTwitterInstagramKOO APPYOUTUBE Visual Stories  Most elegant saree looks of Samantha Ruth PrabhuEntertainment10 times Kiara Advani's mom Genevieve Advani dressed better than any Bollywood celebLifestyleKhushi Kapoor sets hearts racing with her bewitching photosindiaKedarnath Temple to get golden urn during Chardham Yatra this yearLifestyleKrishna Mukherjee’s classy beachwear collectiontvSteal worthy attires from Jasmin Bhasin's wardrobe for Holi Party 2023EntertainmentDiljit Dosanjh's 8-ingredient desi chai is the best way to begin the dayFood10 Bollywood celebs who no longer eat meatLifestyleAlaya F wows the internet in a stylish bikiniindia123ElectionsAssembly Elecetions 2023Elections 2023Nagaland Election ResultsMeghalaya Election ResultTripura Election ResultKarnataka Elections 2023Exit Polls 2023Tripura Exit PollsTop TrendingExit Polls 2023South Africa vs West IndiesPM Kisan SchemeChandrayaan 3Foreign Ministers MeetBihar Budget 2023 LiveTrending StoriesIn IndiaEntire WebsiteMeet the Muslims BJP wants to wooPumping up the price: Why are petrol prices still so high in India?'BJP scared of Lalu Yadav in Bihar, sending central agencies': Rabri DeviS Jaishankar: India expects FTA with EU to be 'game-changer'Amit Shah, JP Nadda hold deliberations with Telangana BJP leadersJoin this IISc course on Intelligent AutomationMIT xPRO’s COO ProgrammeProtect your EV with electric vehicle insuranceChandrayaan-3: Engine powering rocket’s cryo upper stage testedG20 Foreign Minister's Meeting: Chinese foreign minister to visit India for first time after India's LAC warning30k in MP uploaded child abuse material; over 4,000 likely to be arrestedLive: SC to hear Manish Sisodia's bail plea shortlyMeet the Muslims BJP wants to wooChinese foreign minister to visit India on sidelines of G20B'luru: Father hacked to death after son gives Rs 1cr supariRahul's removal as vice-captain indicates nothing: RohitHow institutional casteism ‘murdered’ this IIT studentNIA, ATS, Mumbai cops hunt for 'ultra' trained in China, PakParticipate in the Times EdTech SurveyWhy are petrol prices still so high in India?About usCreate Your Own AdTerms of Use and Grievance Redressal Policy Privacy policyAdvertise with usRSSNewsletterFeedbackePaperSitemapArchivesFOLLOW US ONOther Times Group News SitesThe Economic TimesHindi Economic TimesNavbharat TimesMaharashtra TimesVijaya KarnatakaTelugu SamayamTamil SamayamMalayalam SamayamEi SamayI am GujaratTimesPointsIndiatimesBrand CapitalEducation TimesTimes FoodMiss KyraMumbai MirrorBangalore MirrorPopular CategoriesHeadlinesSports NewsBusiness NewsIndia NewsWorld NewsBollywood NewsHealth & Fitness TipsIndian TV ShowsCelebrity PhotosHot on the WebRashmika MandannaHrithik RoshanHoney RosesBollywood CouplesSouth Indian ActorShreyas IyerAbby Choi Murder CaseVastu TipsRakesh SujathasShehnaaz GillTop TrendsExit Polls 2023South Africa vs West IndiesPM Kisan SchemeChandrayaan 3Foreign Ministers MeetBihar Budget 2023 LiveDelhi Excise Policy CaseManish SisodiaMumbai Train AccidentB S YediyurappaGautam AdaniIndia GDPBank Holidays in MarchEPFO High PensionNagaland Election Exit PollsTripura Election ResultCryptocurrency Price in IndiaIPL Schedule 2023Trending TopicsParineeti ChopraParenting TipsRelationships TipsShark Tank India 2Rich Dosa RecipesGondola Rides In VeniceMalaika AroraMushroom BenefitsSAG Awards 2023Heart DiseasesBest Food For HealthGenelia D'SouzaBollywood Actor TransformationsShanthi PriyaAlia BhattBollywood CelebritiesVivo Y55sLaptops under 30000WiFi RoutersTablets under 15000Living and entertainmentiDivaMensXP.comFeminaETimesGraziaZoomTravel DestinationsBombay TimesCricbuzz.comFilmfareOnline SongsTVLifestyleLongwalks AppNewspaper SubscriptionFood NewsTimes PrimeWhats HotServicesCouponDuniaMagicbricksTechGigTimesJobsBollywood NewsTimes MobileGadgets NowCareersColombiaCopyright © 2023 Bennett, Coleman & Co.

(File)New Delhi: India expects its proposed free trade agreement with the European Union to be a ""game-changer"" and is looking forward to a mutually advantageous conclusion to the negotiation process for the pact within a ""short planned timeline"", External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said on Tuesday.In an address at an event at the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Jaishankar also said that Europe and India can strengthen each other's strategic autonomy by reducing dependencies, cooperating on critical technologies, and ensuring supply-chain restructuring.""We expect the India-EU FTA will be a game-changer for the India-EU relationship. We look forward to a mutually beneficial, mutually advantageous conclusion to the negotiation process within a reasonably short planned timeline,"" he said.In June last year, India and the European Union restarted the negotiations for the long-pending trade and investment agreement after a gap of over eight years. Launched in June 2007, the negotiations for the proposed agreement have witnessed many hurdles as both sides had major differences on crucial issues.""India's new approach to trade agreements addresses issues of non-tariff and behind-the-border barriers, quality standards, and related benchmarks,"" Mr Jaishankar said.""With like-minded partners, we have actually demonstrated in recent years a fast-track change in our FTA negotiation processes. FTAs with the UAE and Australia were actually concluded in record time,"" he said.Behind-the-border barriers are non-tariff discriminatory trade barriers within a country.""Europe and India can strengthen each other's strategic autonomy by reducing dependencies; cooperating on critical technologies; and ensuring supply-chain restructuring. The India-EU FTA is, therefore, our very important goal,"" Mr Jaishankar said.The external affairs minister said the recently unveiled Trade and Technology Council (TTC) will provide the structure and strategic guidance to the partnership between the two sides.The TTC is expected to facilitate the exchange of critical technologies relating to an array of domains, including artificial intelligence, quantum computing, semiconductors, and cyber security.The TTC with India is the European Union's second such technology partnership after the first one with the United States which was firmed up in June 2021.""I would like to say that India's relations with Europe are stronger and deeper than ever before and this event itself is a testimony of that assertion,"" Mr Jaishankar said.PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com""Between us, rests the largest democratic and free market space globally. The business communities of India and Europe have a large stake and an enabling role in this transformation,"" he said.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)Featured Video Of The DayOn Camera, Bihar Cops Drag, Arrest Father Of Soldier Who Died In GalwanTrack Latest News Live on NDTV.com and get news updates from India  and around the world.

Instead, Formula 1 has introduced its own OTT video platform to watch all the action live, called F1 TV.The F1 TV is available in two different plans - F1 TV Access and F1 TV Pro. While the former will get you live timing data and delayed race replays, the latter is a premium plan which you would need to watch every F1 2023 race live or on demand. The F1 TV Access plan would cost you $19.99 or Rs 1,653 for one year, while the F1 TV Pro is priced at $29.99 for the same period, which converts to about Rs 2,480 in Indian currency. There's also a monthly plan which will cost you $2.99 and $3.99 for the Access and Pro plans respectively.Driving on India's largest Go-Kart track - Formula 11 Karting | TOI AutoIn comparison, the Disney HotStar+ Super (basic) plan, which was the OTT platform to watch Formula 1 races in 2022, currently costs Rs 899 for a year. This means that watching F1 in India will get 3 times more expensive in 2023 with F1 TV Pro, the exclusive platform to stream all races throughout the season. Moreover, the Disney HotStar+ plan also offered additional services like movies, other live sports, TV, and more, while the F1 TV Pro subscription will limit you to the motorsport series.Nonetheless, the F1 TV Pro subscription will broadcast all the live action from the race weekends, including practice and qualifying sessions, Sprint races, and of course, the main Grand Prix races. In addition, you get access to live onboard cameras and team radio, watch Formula 1 race replays and highlights, live stream (and replay) F2, F3 and Porsche Supercup, watch exclusive F1 shows, get real time telemetry including live driver maps.

At $70 billion, AI for the first time confirmed the list price of its record order for 470 aircraft that are a mix of Airbus and Boeing wide and narrow bodies. Five ex-Delta Boeing 777s have already begun flying on North America routes.Read Also900 pilots, 4,200 cabin crew: Air India to go on hiring spree after record aircraft dealAfter a mega deal with Airbus and Boeing, Air India now plans to hire over 4,200 cabin crew and 900 pilots this year as the airline looks to revamp its fleet. Earlier this month, the Tata Group-owned airline signed a whopping $80 billion deal with Airbus and Boeing to purchase 470 aircraft. It alsoThe first of the 40 legacy wide-body aircraft that are being refurbished will join the fleet in mid-2024. “Air India has embarked on probably the greatest transformation in aviation history” Wil- son said, calling the initial months post the privatization “the taxiing phase”. On Monday, Wilson spoke to the media for the first time after the Tatas placed a record firm order for 470 aircraft along with an option for 370 more. “We will finance this order through several modes. There will be equity, sale and lease back and other financing options,” he said. While the merger with Vis- tara is pending regulatory approval, the integration of Air India Express and AirAsia In- dia is underway, he said.Read AlsoFull-service carrier to be known as Air India post Vistara mergerNew Delhi, Feb 27 (PTI) As the group works on becoming a significant international aviation player, Air India chief Campbell Wilson on Monday said the full-service carrier post the merger of Vistara will be known as Air India which is much more recognised outside the country.“The intention is to end up with one full service airline and one low-cost airline in the group. The full service airline will be an amalgam of Air India and Vistara. But we expect many of the practices and systems to be those of Vistara. Being a young- er, private airline, it has been able to imbibe the learnings that it brings from its other shareholders.” The shareholder he referred to is Singapore Airlines (SIA). Ten-year-old Vistara is a 51:49 joint venture between Tata Group and SIA. Last year, SIA and Tata Group announced a merger between Air India and Vistara with SIA holding 25.1% of the merged entity. Speaking about fleet and improved passenger cabin, he said that since 2022, over 20 planes that had been grounded for years are back in the air and capacity has increased by 78%.“We are hiring 500 cabin crew every month and have a strong pipeline of personnel. A training academy is in the works that will train personnel not just for AI but other airlines, too,” Wilson said. AI will also hire expat cre8w members to expedite growth. Six twin aisle A350s were ready for Aeroflot but after the war on Ukraine and sanctions on Russia, Airbus can’t deliver them to the airline. These planes will now come to Air India this year in the configuration as Aeroflot had ordered them — 28 business, 24 comfort (premium economy) and 264 economy seats. Due to supply chain issues, AI will not be changing this layout of passenger accommodations (LOPA) as that would delay their induction.And cabin refurbishment of the existing wide-body aircraft will be completed as per part of the $400 million programme by next year.Start a ConversationFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIAFacebookTwitterInstagramKOO APPYOUTUBE Visual Stories  A look at Imlie fame Seerat Kapoor's Cheeni-inspired outfitstvInteresting experiences in Punjab for the traveller in youtravelG20 Summit: Special Haryanvi Menu for foreign delegatesFood10 alluring photos of Amritha AiyerEntertainmentHoli 2023: Ten Indian actresses in Rain songs and wet clothes…!EntertainmentMood-boosting foods that are not chipsLifestyle18 types of Fries that are worth a tryFoodCelebrities who started crowd-funding pagesEntertainment10 ways to elevate Thandai this HoliFood123ElectionsAssembly Elecetions 2023Elections 2023Nagaland Election ResultsMeghalaya Election ResultTripura Election ResultKarnataka Elections 2023Exit Polls 2023Tripura Exit PollsTop TrendingExit Polls 2023KL RahulHoroscope TodayTMC Twitter AccountLeh Ice Wall ClimbingManish SisodiaTrending StoriesIn BusinessEntire WebsiteIndian economy seen losing speed as rising rates hurt demandScorching rally in India consumer stocks over, top manager saysSebi mulls uniform expense ratio for mutual funds to curb mis-sellingWhite House gives federal agencies 30 days to enforce TikTok banFlying out of Lucknow to cost more; Adani seeks steep hikeMIT xPRO’s COO ProgrammeProtect your EV with electric vehicle insuranceISB's Chief Digital Officer ProgrammeZee Entertainment shares rally over 8%Adani plans to repay up to $790 million share-backed loans by March: ReportAs Russia faces curbs, Air India to get this year six wide-body A350s meant for Aeroflot30K in MP uploaded child abuse material; over 4k likely to be arrestedWhy Adani's woes are bad news for another tycoonB'luru: Father hacked to death after son gives Rs 1 cr supari'Fingers pointed at one community': SC junks plea to rename placesShould you opt for EPFO high pension scheme?Story of the costliest apartment ever sold in IndiaA month on, Adani drops from 3rd to 38th in rich listExcise policy case: Sisodia moves SC against CBI arrestDays of 'Made-in-India' passenger aircraft not far off: PMother calculatorsSIP CalculatorA SIP calculator is a simple tool that allows individuals to get an idea of the returns on theirCalculate NowPPF CalculatorThis financial tool allows one to resolve their queries related to Public Provident Fund account.Calculate NowFD CalculatorWhen investing in a fixed deposit, the amount you deposit earns interest as per the prevailing...Calculate NowNPS CalculatorThe National Pension System or NPS is a measure to introduce a degree of financial stability...Calculate NowMutual Fund CalculatorMutual Funds are one of the most incredible investment strategies that offer better returns...Calculate Now12345About usCreate Your Own AdTerms of Use and Grievance Redressal Policy Privacy policyAdvertise with usRSSNewsletterFeedbackePaperSitemapArchivesFOLLOW US ONOther Times Group News SitesThe Economic TimesHindi Economic TimesNavbharat TimesMaharashtra TimesVijaya KarnatakaTelugu SamayamTamil SamayamMalayalam SamayamEi SamayI am GujaratTimesPointsIndiatimesBrand CapitalEducation TimesTimes FoodMiss KyraMumbai MirrorBangalore MirrorPopular CategoriesHeadlinesSports NewsBusiness NewsIndia NewsWorld NewsBollywood NewsHealth & Fitness TipsIndian TV ShowsCelebrity PhotosHot on the WebRashmika MandannaHrithik RoshanHoney RosesBollywood CouplesBaby NamesRakhi SawantSachin Shroff WeddingVastu TipsRakesh SujathasShehnaaz GillTop TrendsExit Polls 2023KL RahulHoroscope TodayTMC Twitter AccountLeh Ice Wall ClimbingManish SisodiaManipur EarthquakeUmesh Pal MurderShiv SenaB S YediyurappaGautam AdaniCBSE Board Exam 2023Bank Holidays in MarchEPFO High PensionNagaland Election Exit PollsTripura Election ResultCryptocurrency Price in IndiaIPL Schedule 2023Trending TopicsParineeti ChopraParenting TipsRelationships TipsShark Tank India 2Rich Dosa RecipesGondola Rides In VeniceOld FridgeMushroom BenefitsSAG Awards 2023Heart DiseasesBest Food For HealthGenelia D'SouzaBollywood Actor TransformationsShanthi PriyaAlia BhattBollywood CelebritiesVivo Y55sLaptops under 30000WiFi RoutersTablets under 15000Living and entertainmentiDivaMensXP.comFeminaETimesGraziaZoomTravel DestinationsBombay TimesCricbuzz.comFilmfareOnline SongsTVLifestyleLongwalks AppNewspaper SubscriptionFood NewsTimes PrimeWhats HotServicesCouponDuniaMagicbricksTechGigTimesJobsBollywood NewsTimes MobileGadgets NowCareersColombiaCopyright © 2023 Bennett, Coleman & Co.

(PTI Photo)NEW DELHI: Having already secured the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, India will be looking to enhance their aura of invincibility at home with another series win against an Australian side that will need a monumental effort to bounce back in the third Test, starting in Indore on Wednesday.India will not only be looking for a guaranteed World Test Championship final spot in June, but also for a record-extending 16th straight series win at home.Leading 2-0 in a four-match series, India are sitting pretty and just need to make one tough decision of choosing between out-of-form KL Rahul and Shubman Gill.Rahul is no more the vice-captain of the side but the team management has shown tremendous faith in him and he might well get another opportunity to get back among the runs.The only hundred of the series, which has been dominated by spinners, has come from the bat of Rohit Sharma. If India get to bat on day one, the conditions will be ideal for the likes of Cheteshwar Pujara and Virat Kohli to pile on the runs.The trio of Ravindra Jadeja, R Ashwin and Axar Patel has not just delivered with the ball, it has also scored the bulk of the runs so far in the series. Since they can't be expected to get runs in the lower order regularly, the onus lies on the top-order.Contrary to Australia's inexplicable sweeping tactics, Indian batters have adopted the conventional approach against the impressive Australian spinners.Rohit has been brilliant with his feet movement, Kohli too has looked assured in the middle and an unbeaten 31 from Cheteshwar Pujara in his 100th Test must have made him more confident going into the third Test.The square at the Holkar Stadium houses pitches with both black and red soil. The curators have decided to go with the black soil, which usually doesn't offer as much turn and bounce compared to red soil tracks.Their battered and bruised opponents, Australia, have got a lot of time to reflect on their defeats in Nagpur and Delhi. The debacle in Delhi, where they effectively lost the game in session, should hurt more.In terms of their squad composition, a lot has changed with Pat Cummins back in Australia to be with his ailing mother. Ashton Agar, Josh Hazlewood and David Warner too are back home. Steve Smith will lead the side.The visitors could not be faulted for the amount of effort they are putting in to stage a comeback in the series.They seem ready to shun the inexplicable sweeping tactics they employed in Delhi and are expected to take a more conventional approach to counter the rampaging Ashwin and Jadeja.Such has been their domination that Patel has only got to bowl 26 overs.How the Australians defend against the spinners will be key to their chances here. Runs are always vital but their batters need to bat long. It has to be a mix of caution and aggression as the over attacking style of play is likely to be counter-productive.Travis Head is expected to open alongside Usman Khawaja.Khawaja struck a well-made 81 in Delhi and Head briefly put pressure on the spinners with his aggressive play. Trust Head to continue in the same fashion while Khawaja will be expected to play the waiting game.The fulcrum of their batting, Smith and Labuschagne, average less than 30 so far in the series and without their runs, an Australia fightback will be highly unlikely.All-rounder Cameron Green is fit again alongside Mitchell Starc and both are expected to start on Wednesday. Australia are likely to continue with three specialists spinners in Nathan Lyon, Todd Murphy and Matthew Kuhnemann.Teams (from):India: Rohit Sharma (c), KL Rahul, Shubman Gill, Cheteshwar Pujara, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, KS Bharat, Ishan Kishan, Ravichandran Ashwin, Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, Ravindra Jadeja, Mohammed Shami, Mohammed Siraj, Umesh Yadav, Suryakumar Yadav, Jaydev UnadkatAustralia: Scott Boland, Alex Carey, Cameron Green, Peter Handscomb, Travis Head, Usman Khawaja, Matt Kuhnemann, Marnus Labuschagne, Nathan Lyon, Lance Morris, Todd Murphy, Matthew Renshaw, Steve Smith (captain), Mitchell Starc, Mitchell Swepson(With PTI inputs)Start a ConversationFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIAFacebookTwitterInstagramKOO APPYOUTUBE Visual Stories  Diljit Dosanjh's 8-ingredient desi chai is the best way to begin the dayFood10 Bollywood celebs who no longer eat meatLifestyleHot makeup looks of Mrunal ThakurLifestyle11 times Malaika Arora proved she is the queen of fashionEntertainmentAlaya F wows the internet in a stylish bikiniindiaA look at Imlie fame Seerat Kapoor's Cheeni-inspired outfitstvInteresting experiences in Punjab for the traveller in youtravelG20 Summit: Special Haryanvi Menu for foreign delegatesFood10 alluring photos of Amritha AiyerEntertainment123Hockey World CupGraham ReidHockey World CupHockey World Cup 2023Hockey World Cup ScheduleHockey World Cup Points TableHockey World Cup TrophyRourkela Birsa Munda Hockey StadiumTop TrendingExit Polls 2023KL RahulPM Kisan SchemeManish SisodiaMumbai Train AccidentBihar Budget 2023 LiveTrending StoriesIn SportsEntire Website3rd Test: India eye WTC final spot against down and out AustraliaMessi wins FIFA Best prize, Putellas claims women's awardAustralia batsmen will aim to slow things down: SmithWalk down memory lane: The 3 narrowest wins by runs in men's TestsWhat a thriller!
